<p>Randomized self-blinded experiment A.</p>
<p>Cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time

<ul>
<li>Time for filling: 35 minutes</li>
<li>Time for preparing envelopes: 40 minutes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cost of caffeine pills:</li>
<li>Cost of empty capsules:</li>
</ul>
<p>200mg caffeine pills, placebo pills filled with sugar, of each 25.
Put each pill with a corresponding piece of paper ("C" for caffeine,
"P" for placebo) into an unlabeled envelope.  Used <code>seq 1 50 | shuf</code>
to number the envelopes, and sorted them accordingly.</p>
<p>Variables tracked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation performance: Started 0-60 minutes after taking the dose</li>
<li>Flashcard performance: Started 0-60 minutes after finishing meditation</li>
<li>Mood</li>
<li>Productivity</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes on the experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>3rd dose: Out of fear that the placebo pills have some sugar stuck
outside of them, which could de-blind the dose, I take a bit (~10 g)
of sugar with each pill.</li>
<li>7th dose: Increase time between consumption and starting to meditate to
~45 minutes, after finding out that the onset of action is 45 minutes-1
hour.</li>
<li>14th dose: Noticed that during meditation, sharpness/clarity of
attention is ~high, and relaxing after becoming mindful is easy, but
attention strays just as easily.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Creatine"><a class="hanchor" href="#Creatine">Creatine</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/creatine/">Examine</a>. I
follow the loading procedure detailed
<a href="https://examine.com/supplements/creatine/#NJj4E2e-do-i-need-to-load-creatine">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/creatine/">Creatine</a> is a supplement that is known for having a 'loading' phase followed by a 'maintenance' phase. A typical creatine cycle has three parts to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take 20-25g (or 0.3g/kg) for 5-7 days (Loading)</li>
<li>Then take 5g daily for 3-4 weeks (Maintenance)</li>
<li>Take a week or two off creatine, and then repeat (Wash-out)</li>
</ul>

<p>First dose was taken on 2023-01-06.</p>
<p>I'm especially interested in the effects of
creatine on my cognition (it <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/creatine/">increases IQ in

<h2 id="LTheanine"><a class="hanchor" href="#LTheanine">L-Theanine</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>L-Theanine is synergistic with caffeine in regards to attention
switching<sup><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-318">[318]</a></sup>
and
alertness<sup><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-319">[319]</a><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-320">[320]</a></sup>
and reduces susceptibility to distractions
(focus).<sup><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-320">[320]</a><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-320">[321]</a></sup>
However, alertness seems to be relatively subjective
and may not be a reliable increase between these two
compounds,<sup><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-318">[318]</a></sup>
and increases in mood are either present of
absent.<sup><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-322">[322]</a><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-318">[318]</a><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-323">[323]</a></sup>
This may be due to theanine being a relatively subpar
nootropic in and of itself pertaining to the above parameters,
but augmenting caffeine's effects; some studies do note
that theanine does not affect the above parameters in and of
itself.<sup><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-324">[324]</a></sup>
Due to this, any insensitivity or habituation to caffeine would reduce
the effects of the combination as L-theanine may work through caffeine.</p>
<p>L-Theanine does not appear to be synergistic with caffeine
in regards to attention to a prolonged and monotonous
task.<sup><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/research/#ref-325">[325]</a></sup>

<p>I started taking nicotine (in the form of nicotine chewing gum with 2mg of
active ingredient) in high-pressure situations (e.g. I'm procrastinating
on an important task and have anxiety around it, or during exams). So far,
it seems especially useful to break me out of an akratic rut.</p>
