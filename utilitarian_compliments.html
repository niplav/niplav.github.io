<h1 id="Compliments_as_Utilitarian_Praxis"><a class="hanchor" href="#Compliments_as_Utilitarian_Praxis">Compliments as Utilitarian Praxis</a></h1>
<!--TODO: give compliments based on importance, tractability,
neglectedness: People who are need compliments, people who have something
they can be complimented about, and people who are rarely complimented.-->
<p>It seems like <!--TODO: source here, perhaps a link to reddit of people
complaining about not getting enough compliments--> people don't get
as many compliments as they want, and that getting a compliment greatly
enhances the quality of their lives. <!--TODO: Again, link to a reddit
thread of people talking about how they remember compliments from years
ago.--> Some people even report to remember compliments months or even
years after they get them and are very happy about them.</p>
<p>This creates a good opportunity for utilitarians (both hedonic and
preference) to use otherwise wasted time. Since there is often time
where one has nothing to do (e.g waiting at a trainstation, an airport,
or while at the checkout line at the grocery store) and that can't
be used productively otherwise, a utilitarian could make somebody a
compliment in that time. This is of course only advisable if the time
can't be used productively otherwise (for example by earning money to
donate, learning something or contributing to a project).</p>
<p>There seem to be two advantages in this scenario, one for the
compliment-giver and one for the compliment-receiver. Giving compliments
is usually fun, and therefore makes both the compliment-giver and
the compliment-receiver happier. It also entails contact with other
humans in a positive situation, and might be useful for increasing the
compliment-giver's well-being and therewith productivity.</p>
<p>Since utilitarians would care about the marginal value of a compliment,
it would be best to give compliments to people who receive the highest
marginal value by a compliment. This would probably be people who rarely
receive compliments (under the assumption that compliments have steeply
diminishing marginal returns), which would perhaps include people who
are not conventionally attractive, male, and not very well dressed.
When giving these people compliments, there seems to be a problem:
It might not be as easy to give them genuine compliments as to more
conventionally attractive and stylish people, but one can give dishonest
compliments instead. This would lead to two possible problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>People might interpret these compliments as advice on what to wear
and how to look, and since this perceived advice might be harmful, it
may have slight negative effects on social success.</p></li>
<li><p>People might be good at recognising dishonest compliments and
be offended or even sad about the dishonest compliment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Since it doesn't seem hard to find at least one positive aspect of the
visual appearance of a person, it seems advisable to avoid dishonest
but positive compliments.</p>
<p>However,
<a href="https://foundational-research.org/the-case-for-suffering-focused-ethics/">suffering-focused</a>
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/">consequentialists</a>
probably have less incentives to give compliments, since compliments
simply seem to enhance the well-being of a person, and compliments to
random strangers would rarely be given to people who suffer greatly. A
weak case can be made that compliments seem to have a long-term effect
on well-being and might rarely play a role in reducing negative effects
of depression. Still, negative utilitarians have the same otherwise
unusable time of waiting in public space, and might want to capitalize
on this small opportunity.</p>
<h2 id="A_Simple_Calculation"><a class="hanchor" href="#A_Simple_Calculation">A Simple Calculation</a></h2>
<p>Let's say that a compliment is worth <span>$</span>0.50 to the average stranger,
and it (conservatively) takes 1 minute to give the compliment. Let's
say that the opportunity cost is <span>$</span>10. This means that an hour of giving
compliments is worth</p>
<div>
    <span>$</span><span>$</span>(\frac{<span>$</span>0.50}{1\hbox{ compliment}}*\frac{1\hbox{ compliment}}{1\hbox{ min}}*60\hbox{ min})-<span>$</span>10=<span>$</span>25<span>$</span><span>$</span>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, <span>$</span>0.50 is maybe too much for the value of a compliment.
If one instead assumes it to be <span>$</span>0.10, the value of one hour giving
compliments to strangers is</p>
<div>
    <span>$</span><span>$</span>(\frac{<span>$</span>0.10}{1\hbox{ compliment}}*\frac{1\hbox{ compliment}}{1\hbox{ min}}*60\hbox{ min})-<span>$</span>10=<span>$</span>5<span>$</span><span>$</span>
</div>
<h2 id="Caveats"><a class="hanchor" href="#Caveats">Caveats</a></h2>
<p>If one is not properly socially calibrated, a compliment could be
perceived as weird or intrusive and not achieve the desired result of
making the other person feel better. This could also be a problem if
the value of a compliment is heavily dependent on characteristics of
the person giving the compliment.</p>
<p>It seems like men often perceive a compliment
by a woman as an indicator of interest <!-- TODO: read
/usr/local/doc/unread/blackpill/the_misperception_of_sexual_interest_perilloux_et_al_2012.pdf
and quote it--> and respond with flirting. And related
to the caveat about social calibration, compliments by
men might be misperceived as an attempt at flirting or even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_harassment">cat-calling</a> and make
the woman receiving the compliment uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It could be that compliments on visual appearance further a very shallow
and visual image of attractiveness. If the effects of this are strong,
it might be advisable to instead give compliments to acquaintances and
compliment their personality instead of their appearance. However, this
seems unlikely.</p>
<h2 id="Questions"><a class="hanchor" href="#Questions">Questions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>How often do people receive compliments?</li>
<li>Who receives the most/least compliments (gender, age, attractiveness, race etc.)</li>
<li>What is the value of a compliment, i.e how much better does somebody feel upon receiving a compliment (short-term as well as long-term)?</li>
<li>What are the diminishing returns on compliments?</li>
<li>How much is the value of a compliment dependent on the characteristics of the compliment-giver (e.g. stranger/acquaintance, age, gender, attractiveness etc.)?</li>
<li>How able are people to identify fake compliments?</li>
<li>How often do people see compliments as advice?</li>
<li>What is worth more: A weird/creative compliment or a standard compliment? (Example: "I like your hat!" vs. "Your hat reminds me of a painting of a soldier from the French Revolution!")</li>

<p>In 8th grade, every morning when coming to school, I had to go through
the cafeteria to get to my class and my favorite teacher would always
sit there having her morning coffee. I would always smile and say good
morning as I pass by. One morning she suddenly stopped me and said
"I just want to say that it really makes me happy seeing you smile so
wide to me every morning". No one had ever pointed out my smile before,
at least not like that. <strong>Felt a glow for days</strong>.</p>

<p>Besides illustrating that there might be a gender-gap in receiving
compliments, it also shows that there might be some preference for
compliments by acquaintances, on not directly visible characteristics,
which speaks slightly against giving compliments to strangers.</p>

with a booth for some kind of campaign I can't remember. When I went

<p>This indicates that comments might be taken as advice, which should lead
to caution what to compliment.</p>

<p>Again, a compliment from the opposite sex seems worth more, at least
for men. Perhaps because it signals sexual interest, which is an good
position to be in.</p>
<p>Problem: These questions pose quite a selection bias: Nobody who has
received a compliment and thought nothing of it bothers to write a reddit
comment about that.</p>
