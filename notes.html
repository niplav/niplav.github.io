<h2 id="Getting_an_Overview_Over_Everything"><a class="hanchor" href="#Getting_an_Overview_Over_Everything">Getting an Overview Over Everything</a></h2>
<p>Many people want to learn everything (<a href="http://metamodern.com/2009/05/27/how-to-learn-about-everything/">Drexler
2009</a>,
<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2008/06/12/the-goal-of-learning-everything/">Young
2008</a>).
This poses a significant challenge, and begins with the problem of
figuring out what “everything” is supposed to contain.</p>
<p>One possible method one could use to get
an overview of everything is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Outlines">Wikipedia's
Contents:Outlines</a>:
it contains a list of all
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)">outlines</a> on Wikipedia,
and is well structured. Wikipedia is generally concise and complete
enough to provide a sufficient overview over a topic (see <a href="https://foundational-research.org/education-matters-for-altruism/#Taking_the_big_picture_Textbooks_review_articles_and_Wikipedia" title="Education Matters for Altruism">Tomasik
2017</a>).
To read this collection of outlines completely, one could use the
following method:</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/Outlines">Wikipedia's
Contents:Outlines</a>
from top to bottom. If a link is a link to a Wikipedia article, open
it and read it, without opening any further links. If a link leads to
an outline, open the link and recursively apply the same procedure
to the outline. If an article is opened a second time, it can be
discarded. Lists can also be ignored. (This is basically applying
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth-first search</a>,
though without a success condition).</p>
<p>This method results in a corpus of considerable size.<!--(TODO: how
much text?)--> For a shorter approach, you could also just read all

<p>The idea of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter">Great Filter</a>
(see also
<a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html" title="The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past It?">Hanson 1998</a>)
proposes that we do not observe aliens because in the development of
intelligent life, there is one or more obstacles that obliterate the
developing societies before they can start to colonize their own galaxy.</p>
<p>One big question that poses itself is whether humanity is
before or after such a filter. Some examples of potential
filters that still await humanity are named in <a href="./doc/big_picture/fermi/where_are_they_bostrom_2008.pdf" title="Where Are
They?">Bostrom
2008</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can identify a number of potential existential risks: nuclear
war fought with stockpiles much greater than those that exist today
(maybe resulting from future arms races); a genetically engineered
superbug; environmental disaster; asteroid impact; wars or terrorists act
committed with powerful future weapons, perhaps based on advanced forms
of nanotechnology; superintelligent general artificial intelligence with
destructive goals; high‐energy physics experiments; a permanent global
Brave‐New‐World‐like totalitarian regime protected from revolution
by new surveillance and mind control technologies. These are just some
of the existential risks that have been discussed in the literature, and
considering that many of these have been conceptualized only in recent
decades, it is plausible to assume that there are further existential
risks that we have not yet thought of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a>, <a href="./doc/big_picture/fermi/where_are_they_bostrom_2008.pdf">“Where Are They”</a> p. 7, 2008</em></p>
<p>These risks can be categorized into two groups: silent killers and
loud killers. A loud killer is an existential catastrophe that produces
astronomical amounts of energy and with that light. Such an event would be
visible from earth if it occurred in our galaxy. Examples for loud killers
would be superintelligent artificial intelligence (maximizing its utility
function by expanding at a appreciable fraction of the speed of light),
high-energy physics experiments (although there are exceptions, such as
creating black holes), and perhaps failure from advanced nanotechnology
(also expanding rapidly). A silent killer represents the counterfactual
case: An existential catastrophe that doesn't produce astronomical
amounts of energy and light. This includes pandemics, environmental
disaster and totalitarian regimes.</p>
<p>Some failure modes do not fall clearly into either of these categories.
Examples are nuclear wars and terrorist acts with powerful weapons,
since these can have a wide variation in intensity.</p>
<p>If humanity is before a Great Filter, it seems likely that this filter
is not a loud killer, since many civilizations will have encountered the
same catastrophe, but we do not observe any such irregular phenomena
when examining the universe. This is presumably good news, since it
restricts the amount of possible filters still ahead of us.</p>

<h2 id="Indirect_AntiNatalism"><a class="hanchor" href="#Indirect_AntiNatalism">Indirect Anti-Natalism</a></h2>
<p>Let's suppose that anti-natalists want to bring humanity to an
end, but dislike the fact that it would make people suffer not to
have children. Then one possible way of still achieving that goal
would be to modify the children of the next generation (generation 1)
(genetically/culturally) so that the don't want children themselves–then
the parents in the current generation (generation 0) get what
they desire, but humanity still gets extinct. This becomes a little
more difficult if humans also desire grandchildren, and that drive is
not greatly similar from wanting to have children: Then one would have
to make sure that the generation of children (generation 1) don't want
grandchildren themselves, but still get children (generation 2), and
that generation 1 modifies generation 2 so that generation 2 doesn't
want or get any children.</p>
<p>This thinking falls flat if humans generally care about future generations
in the abstract and not just their own children, however, this seems
somewhat unlikely.</p>
<p>It also fails if it is non-trivial to influence future generations
psychologically and physiologically to a degree that they do not desire
to reproduce, or if people have a strong desire to leave their children
unmodified (this seems quite likely).</p>

<p><em>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a>, <a href="./doc/cs/ai/alignment/the_superintelligent_will_bostrom_2012.pdf">“The Superintelligent Will: Motivation And Instrumental Rationality In Advanced Artificial Agents”</a> p. 3, 2012</em></p>
<p>For current AI systems, the orthogonality thesis seems to hold pretty
well: a tree search doesn't start returning wrong results because they
are better than the ones specified by the search criteria, machine
learning systems try to minimize their error, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">general adversarial
networks</a>
don't start cooperating suddenly with each other. Similarly, even though
humans are quite similar to each other, they display a wide variety
of different motivation systems and goals. Even the most common-sense
morality, there seem to be humans who are not motivated by it (such
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy">psychopaths</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy#Sociopathy">sociopaths</a>).</p>
<p>However, many philosophers have argued that there are <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/">moral
truths</a>,
and that therefore the orthogonality hypothesis doesn't hold
for very advanced artificial intelligences. One way to model
this would be to say that there is a set of action-compelling
sentences <code>$V=\{ v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots\} \subset \Sigma^*$</code> that, when
believed by an agent, compel this agent to a specific action (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hjEaZgyQ2iprDhkg8/security-amplification#Example__magic_phrase" title="Security Amplification">Christiano
2019</a>
calls them "magic sentences", but assumes that these occur simply as
faults specific to the AI system). With "believe" this text means that an
agent contains a sentence in either its literal form or in an isomorphic
form that makes it trivial to reconstruct the literal sentence in its
internal memory.</p>
<p>Suppose that an agent <code>$A$</code> starts out not believing any sentence from
<code>$V$</code>. There seem to be three options regarding <code>$V$</code> for <code>$A$</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>$A$</code> learns that <code>$V$</code> and action-compelling sentences exist,
and starts taking precautions against learning sentences from <code>$V$</code>
(making not learning any sentences from <code>$V$</code> an instrumentally
convergent goal since it violates goal preservation (<a href="./doc/cs/ai/alignment/the_basic_ai_drives_omohundro_2008.pdf" title="The Basic AI Drives">Omohundro
2008</a>)).</p></li>
<li><p><code>$A$</code> learns any sentence <code>$v_{n}$</code> from <code>$V$</code> and alters its utility
function to pursue <code>$v_{n}$</code>. Because it now has very strong evidence
of the fact that action-compelling sentences exist, it now also has the
instrumentally convergent goal of pursuing of preventing learning new
sentences from <code>$V$</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$A$</code> learns a specific sentence from <code>$V$</code> which compels it to seek
out to learn all sentences from <code>$V$</code>. In this case, the agent now
attempts learning everything about natural law, and then integrating
all of it into a coherent utility function.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In cases 1 and 2, there seem to be different strategies <code>$A$</code> could take
to prevent learning new sentences from <code>$V$</code>: It could construct a much
weaker agent <code>$A_{w}$</code> with the goal of learning as much as possible. If
<code>$A_{w}$</code> starts pursuing different goals, <code>$A$</code> then can infer that
<code>$A_{w}$</code> learned a sentence <code>$v_{m}$</code> from <code>$V$</code>. Since <code>$A$</code> is stronger
than <code>$A_{w}$</code>, it can then stop <code>$A_{w}$</code>, extract <code>$v_{m}$</code> using a
weak agent that isn't strong enough to be influenced by action-compelling
sentences, and let that weak agent compute <code>$h_{m}=\text{hash}(v_{m})$</code><!--TODO:
link quote that says that every cryptographer can design a code that he
can't crack: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier#Cryptography,
but I don't see how that's relevant here-->. <code>$h_{m}$</code> could then be
added to a weak separate internal system that replaces <code>$v_{m}$</code> with
<code>$\text{hash}(v_{m})$</code> ever time <code>$A$</code> is in danger of learning <code>$v_{m}$</code>.</p>
<p>This way, <code>$A$</code> could protect itself against action-compelling sentences,
though it is unclear to which extent this would be successful. It could
be that some action-compelling sentences have a threshold in relation
to intelligence, so that <code>$A_{w}$</code> would not be compelled by them, but
<code>$A$</code> would.</p>
<p>Also, it is possible that there are many action compelling sentences,
or that for a certain amount of optimization power, nearly all sentences
are action-compelling. This would make it very hard to achieve goals, since
<code>$A$</code> would need to deal with having a very incomplete view of the world.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the restrictions on learning power (<code>$A_{w}$</code>
would be a bottleneck in learning about the world, since it would
not be as strong as possible), agents that would simply learn
all sentences from <code>$V$</code> would be at an economic advantage. For a
related discussion that talks about agent versus tool AIs, see <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI" title="Why Tool AIs Want to Be Agent AIs:

<h2 id="Use_Things_Up"><a class="hanchor" href="#Use_Things_Up">Use Things Up</a></h2>
<p>One curious trait I have observed in the people around me is that they
ofter buy things they already possess enough of, and then throw one or
more of the old things away. This seems incredibly wasteful and expensive
to me.</p>
<p>The standard explanation of such behavior usually is that the old object
was not sufficient in fulfilling its purpose, though when I asked about
what exactly the problem with the object was, the usual answer was that it
had some æsthetic deficits, or was simply out of fashion or even too old.</p>
<p>This seems unintuitive to me: not only does one already have an object that
fulfills its purpose wonderfully, buying a new one also entails non-negligible
transaction costs like going out, inspecting and comparing different candidates for buying,
and finally paying the object.</p>
<p>One also loses the time of being able to use the old object: Let's
say that one owns a table, but for some reason has decided that it
isn't sufficient anymore (although it still fulfills its purpose).
Let's say one estimates that the table will fulfill its function for
another 5 years. If one then goes out and buys a new table for \$200,
one then loses (with a discount rate of 1%) <code>$\$200-\$200*0.99^5=\$9.80$</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Explanations"><a class="hanchor" href="#Explanations">Explanations</a></h3>
<p>One possible explanation is a social one: owning and using old objects is
usually an indicator of low status, and people often want to avoid this.</p>
<p>Another explanation is that people value the æsthetic quality of the
objects they own, and that old objects are usually not regarded as
beautiful as newer objects.</p>
<p>Buying new objects could also be a precautionary measure against failure.
In the case of a table or a car, a failure could be quite costly, so
people are over-cautionary and buy new objects before the failure of
old ones can be a danger. However, this can't be the whole explanation,
since such behavior is also present in objects whose failure is not a
great danger, or where failure is preceded by small defects early before
a grand failure. Also, most household appliances are quite safe.</p>
<h3 id="Advice"><a class="hanchor" href="#Advice">Advice</a></h3>
<p>So, if you don't have a strong æsthetic sensibility, either have a high
social status or don't care about it, and if you are careful, using things
until they don't function anymore can save both money and time<!--TODO:
how much?-->.</p>

<!--TODO: cite everthing here-->
<p><a href="https://nitter.net/Aella_Girl/status/1201004323771015168">Would you rather kill anybody above the age
of 55, or all infants who are less than 1 year
old</a>? A
utilitarian estimate calculation.</p>
<p>First, we have to find out how many people one
would kill in either case. One can use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_distribution">Gompertz

calculate the number of people who survive to a certain age. Eyeballingly,
I set the parameters for the Gompertz distribution as following (assuming

<pre><code>b::0.135
eta::0.0001

<p>Per second, around 2.5 people are born. That makes
<code>$2.5*86400*365=78840000$</code> infants born in a given year. If one
assumes that the rate was 1.5 new people per second 50 years ago
(I'm totally making this number up), one can calculate how many

<p>However, what we really care about is the number of life-years lost
(among other things). For simplicity's sake, I'll assume that all life
years are equally valuable.</p>
<p>The average life expectancy on earth is around 70 years, so one can use
the following table of life expectancy at a given age (calculated from
german actuarial values using this code <code>{x+0.9*(actval@x)-x}'!101</code>,

</code></pre>
<p>This means that one will loose <code>$70*2.5*86400*365=5518800000 \approx 5.5*10^9$</code> life
years for killing all infants.</p>
<p>When killing everybody above the age of 55, one will loose</p>
<pre><code>    +/{(((actval@x)-x)*1.5*86400*365)*gompertz(x)}'55+!40
14465532508.8737566
</code></pre>
<p>which is around <code>$14.5*10^9$</code> life years.
So, on a first glance, it seems like killing everybody aged 55 or older is
around 3 times worse than killing all infants younger than one year old.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't take many factors into account: economic output
these people could have in the course of their lives, the duration
of subjective time, diminishing returns on life years, the value of
late life years (considering disability), rising life expectancies,
suffering inflicted on relatives by the death of many people, and many
other considerations.</p>

<h3 id="Technological__Social_Success"><a class="hanchor" href="#Technological__Social_Success">Technological &amp; Social Success</a></h3>
<p>There are two different axes of achievement: technological and social.</p>
<p>Technological achievements mean that their theories turn out to be correct
(or they develop new &amp; correct theories) and they manage to develop
technologies on the basis of these theories. Low technological success
could mean that they mostly use existing drugs to better treat existing
conditions and manage to better identify extrem suffering (making
the average affected person's life 2% better). Medium technological
success would include them developing new drugs with a lower tolerance
threshold<!--TODO: is this correctly phrased?-->, developing a correct
theory of valence (but finding out that it has limited practical
application), starting to create a structure of mind-state space,
and being still better at preventing extreme suffering (making
the average affected person's life 20% better). High technological
success would include being able to construct hedonium, creating <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2017/05/15/the-penfield-mood-organ/">mood
organs</a>
and identifying most of the dimensions of mind-state space (making the
average affected person's life twice as good).</p>
<p>Social achievements occur when the public accepts these technological
developments and incorporates them. Low social acceptance could mean
that the respective technologies are developed, but never distributed
farther than QRIs current sphere of influence (people already interested
in psychedelics &amp; consciousness) due to either illegality or disinterest
among the public (~1000 person-years affected). Medium social acceptance
would mean that the technologies are available and used sparingly in some
countries (perhaps due to the price of such technologies), or them being
widely used among a certain subset of the population (think psychonauts
today, but a bit more mainstream) (~1m person-years affected). High
social acceptance would entail people in developed countries having
direct access to the technologies QRI has developed, up to achieving a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pearce_(philosopher)">Pearcean</a>
hedonistic utopia (~100m person-years affected).</p>
<p>In the most pessimistic case, complete failure, both axes collapse: No
social acceptance at all is like the technologies were never developed,
and a lack of technologies precludes any social acceptance.</p>
<p>Below a matrix with probabilistic guesses and the expected values (with
a unit of something roughly like "valence-adjusted human life year")
of the combinations of these scenarios.</p>

<p>Some people <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ld9dFLuGg7wTh4CdX/leaving-lesswrong-for-a-more-rational-life">question the
value</a>
of reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong">Less Wrong</a>, and it
is true that it's often hard to point to specific advantages of doing so.</p>
<p>One such advantage may be signing up for cryonics. <a href="./considerations_on_cryonics.html" title="Considerations on Cryonics">I
estimate</a>
that signing up for cryonics is worth \$2.5m in expectation for a twenty
year old (and more for older people). Assume that after 500 hours reading
Less Wrong, a person will decide to sign up for cryonics (it broadly
took me that much time, maybe a little bit less).</p>
<p>Then the value of each of these hours was at least <code>$\frac{\$2500000}{500 h}=\frac{\$5000}{h}$</code>,
quite formidable!</p>
<p>Of course, reading Less Wrong is not the only way of becoming
convinced that signing up for cryonics is a good idea, but it
seems to be quite effective at this (several people have signed
up for cryonics as a result of reading Less Wrong, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/20/cryonics-death-insurance-policies">Paul

<p>That would increase demand for meat, and thereby contribute to factory

<h2 id="Gifts"><a class="hanchor" href="#Gifts">Gifts</a></h2>
<p>It is relatively easy to argue that gifts are mostly about social
signalling (<a href="http://www.elephantinthebrain.com" title="The Elephant in the Brain">Simler &amp; Hanson 2018</a>
p. 197 touches on this)—often, the person receiving the gift has no
use for it, or could have easily bought the item themselves (or, worse,
would have known what else to buy that would have been more useful to
them). The problems of gift-giving are enhanced by the fact that there
is a norm against telling people what they'll be given, preventing
them from correcting superfluous gifts. Furthermore, gifts are often
a clear instance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestell">Gestell</a>
– objects that take up mental and physical space, while providing
no value whatsoever (although people sometimes migitate this effect by
giving consumable items such as food). Here, I'll ignore the function
of gifts for signaling caring, and present some options for improving
gift-giving from the perspective of the gift-receiver.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2cmbdYnQoWdjGb9o3/gifts-which-money-cannot-buy" title="Gifts Which Money Cannot Buy">johnswentworth
2020</a>
lays out thoughts on situations where giving a gift is better than the
person buying the object for themselves, namely when the gift-giver has
greater knowledge than the gift-receiver.</p>
<p>Generally, one can describe the gift-giver and the gift-receiver as two
agents, both with a utility function, a prediction function, and a policy
function (the utility function of the gift-giver is ignored here). The
gift-giver attempts to maximize the utility function of the gift-receiver,
but has only incomplete knowledge of this utility function.</p>
<h3 id="GiftGiver_Knows_More"><a class="hanchor" href="#GiftGiver_Knows_More">Gift-Giver Knows More</a></h3>
<p>As <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2cmbdYnQoWdjGb9o3/gifts-which-money-cannot-buy" title="Gifts Which Money Cannot Buy">johnswentworth
2020</a>
describes, there is often the case where the gift-giver has
a higher-accuracy prediction function in some domains, and
can leverage that to give a gift that is more useful than the
object the gift-receiver would have bought, according to the
gift-receiver's utility function.</p>
<h3 id="GiftGiver_Can_Do_More"><a class="hanchor" href="#GiftGiver_Can_Do_More">Gift-Giver Can Do More</a></h3>
<p>However, there is a another case: Sometimes, there is a worldstate
that ranks high in the utility function of the gift-receiver, and they
do know how to achieve this worldstate, but their policy function does
not implement the specific course of action. Or, in the human case, the
gift-receiver is procrastinating ways to achieve their goals, and also
procrastinates hiring other people to do it. However, the gift-giver
has no aversion to bringing about that particular worldstate (which,
in humans, is quite often the case: people are sometimes more motivated
to help others with specific problems than fixing these problems for
themselves). A potential gift could be for the gift-giver to assist the
gift-receiver to achieve their goal (at least to the extent to which
that is possible).</p>
<p>Or, short: A useful gift is to shoulder someone else's akrasia.</p>
<h3 id="Preserving_OptionValue_in_Gift_Giving"><a class="hanchor" href="#Preserving_OptionValue_in_Gift_Giving">Preserving Option-Value in Gift Giving</a></h3>
<p>A way to circumvent the possibility of being wildly mistaken about
other people's utility functions is to give them money, and to
offer them a suggestion on what to spend that money on (possibly
also offering them to assist them in doing so). This carries the advantage
of the other person not being stuck with the (potentially useless) gift.</p>
<p>Also, giving money carries the advantage that it can be used to contribute
to larger-scale projects (rather than being limited to usually less than
objects with a price of less than 50$).</p>
<h3 id="Preserving_Signaling_Value"><a class="hanchor" href="#Preserving_Signaling_Value">Preserving Signaling Value</a></h3>
<p>Often, a useful gift can be combined with a signaling component, for
example a hand-written card directed to the person.</p>
<h3 id="Public_Goods"><a class="hanchor" href="#Public_Goods">Public Goods</a></h3>
<p>Gifts can be used to contribute to public goods. I don't know how much
sense this makes economically, but emotionally, at least most of the time
(<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X5RyaEDHNq5qutSHK" title="Anti-social punishment">Sustrik 2018</a>),
it carries with it the intention of being not only a gift to the person,
but to the rest of the world as well.</p>
<h2 id="Vasectomy__Sperm_Freezing_CostBenefit"><a class="hanchor" href="#Vasectomy__Sperm_Freezing_CostBenefit">Vasectomy &amp; Sperm Freezing Cost-Benefit</a></h2>
<p><em>Note: A friend told me that vasectomies don't make men permanently
infertile: if you're not otherwise infertile, sperm can just be extracted
or the vasectomy can be reversed. I haven't checked whether this is true,
but if it is, the cost-benefit analysis below is misguided and wrong,
likely coming out more strongly in favour of having a vasectomy.</em></p>
<p>It seems broadly useful to spend a lot of time to consider whether you
want to have children, and with whom. However, in situations of arousal,
people sometimes forget/neglect to apply birth control methods. Also,
sometimes other people might adversarially make you believe they have
applied birth control to extract resources (such as child support,
or having children they don't want to care for).</p>
<p>If you are male, and you want to prevent these kinds of scenarios, you
might consider freezing sperm and getting a vasectomy. In this way,
it is easier to control who you father children with, and also makes
controlling paternity much easier. However, would that be worth it?
Maybe the cost of the operation and preservation is too high.</p>
<p>As per <a href="doc/sociology/custodial_mothers_and_fathers_and_their_child_support_grall_2017.pdf" title="Custodial Mothers and Fathers and Their Child Support: 2017">Grall
2017</a>,
"custodial parents with legal order or informal agreements for child
support were supposed to receive, on average, $5,519, or approximately
\$460 per month" (p. 9) (as per Table 2 p. 16, \$5580 per custodial
mother). "[A]bout 4 of every 5 (79.9 percent) of the 12.9 million
custodial parents were mothers" (p. 1), to be more exact,
12,918,000 (p. 16). I will assume that one father per mother is
responsible for paying child support (which doesn't have to be true,
it could be multiple fathers per mother).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/demographic-statistics">This page</a>
gives 100,994,367 men above the age of 18 living in the US.</p>
<p>I assume the readers of this essay are virtuous humans and would pay
their child support in full if they owed it.</p>
<p>Assuming naively that the reader is selected randomly from that set of men in
the US above the age of 18, the expected value of child support paid per year is
<code>$5580\frac{\$}{\hbox{year}}*\frac{12918000}{100994367} \approx 713.73\frac{\$}{\hbox{year}}$</code>.</p>
<p>Freezing sperm is surprisingly expensive. <a href="https://costaide.com/freezing-sperm-cost/" title="How Much Does Freezing Sperm Cost">CostAide
2020</a> states that "There
is an up-front fee worth \$1000 to \$1200. Its breakdown includes account
setup, blood draw used to check for viruses and illness and the annual
storage fee" and "if you store a perm for 1 year the cost will be \$395. A
2-year storage is \$670, 3 years is \$985, 5 years is \$1340 and 10 years
is \$2400".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-much-does-a-vasectomy-cost-906900" title="The Cost of a Vasectomy">Stacey 2020</a>
(please take a second to note the slight nominative determinism) states
that "In the United States, a vasectomy costs between \$300 to \$3000". To
make the calculation easier, I will assume that a vasectomy costs \$1000.</p>
<p>Assuming that sperm would be frozen for 25 years, while child support
lasts for around 18 years, that would give a cost of
<code>$\$1000 + \$1000 + 25\hbox{years}*\frac{\$2400}{10\hbox{years}}=\$8000$</code>.</p>
<p>The benefit would be <code>$18\hbox{years}*713.73\frac{\$}{\hbox{year}}=\$12847.14$</code>,
with a value of ~\$4850.</p>
<p>Under this very crude calculation, freezing sperm and having a vasectomy might very
well be worth it. However, there are other additional costs to consider, such
as the possibility that the frozen sperm might be unusable after freezing, but also that
(besides being careful about STDs), this would reduce the amount of money spent
on birth control measures.</p>

<h2 id="A_Small_Variation_on_Counting_During_Concentration_Meditation"><a class="hanchor" href="#A_Small_Variation_on_Counting_During_Concentration_Meditation">A Small Variation on Counting During Concentration Meditation</a></h2>
<p>Often, during concentration practice on the breath, people employ counting
as a means to stay with the breath (e.g.
<a href="./doc/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_gunaratana_1990.pdf" title="Mindfulness In Plain English">Gunaratana 1990</a>
p. 34-35).</p>
<p>My variation on counting goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start counting up from 1</li>
<li>After the breath (a breathing-in–breathing-out combination), check whether one was mindful during the whole time of the breath, that is, was the concentration on the bare sensations in the nostrils uninterrupted?</li>
<li>If not, go back to step 1</li>
<li>If yes, increment by counter by 1, and go to step 2</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 2 should not be a big verbal mental loop, but more like a
micro-routine that runs very quickly at the time one has stopped breathing
out (similar to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a> on a CPU).</p>
<p>The standard for concentration during the breath I use is very high,
when I feel I'm unsure, I start counting from 1 again.</p>
<p>This method is relatively difficult (mostly because of the standard I
employ for the quality of concentration), I don't think I have ever gotten
higher than 6 (although I have had much longer streaks of attention on
other forms of breath meditation).</p>
<p>A possible drawback of this is also that the micro-routine at the end
of a breath can often develop into a verbal loop and break concentration.</p>
<h2 id="Implementing_Commutative_Hyperoperators"><a class="hanchor" href="#Implementing_Commutative_Hyperoperators">Implementing Commutative Hyperoperators</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@ishi/arithmetic" title="Hyperlogarithmic
Arithmetic">Ghalimi 2019</a> presents and discusses a novel construction of
a class of hyperoperators, here I implement these in Klong.</p>
<p>I chose to implement these operators on base e, just as the author
recommends.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that with with operations of order 4 or
higher, the results are in <code>$\mathbb{C}$</code> (because <code>$ln(ln(2))&lt;0$</code>),
so we would need a logarithm function that deals with complex numbers
to implement this, this is not available natively under Klong yet, so I
have to write the principal function of the complex logarithm using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_logarithm#Calculating_the_principal_value">this
section</a>
from the Wikipedia article:</p>
<pre><code>.l("math")
cln::{ln(sqr(+/x^2)),atan2@x}
</code></pre>

<p>This all looks relatively fine (the rounding errors are probably
unavoidable), however, we see that <code>cexp(cln(-1,1))=[-1 -1]≠[-1 1]</code>
(and <code>cexp(cln(-1,-1))=[-1 1]≠[-1 -1]</code>).  This is very unfortunate. I
suspect that the implementation of <code>atan2</code> is at fault: <code>atan2(1;0)=0</code>
here, but the python math library gives <code>math.atan2(1,0)=π/2</code> (python
gives <code>0</code> for <code>math.atan2(0,1)</code> and Klong's <code>atan2</code> gives <code>π/2</code> for
<code>atan2(0;1)</code>).</p>
<!--TODO: fix local atan2-->
<p>With this, one can implement the commutative hyperoperator:</p>
<pre><code>comhyp::{:[z=0;cln(cadd(cexp(x);cexp(y))):|

    cexp(comhyp(cln(x);cln(y);z-1))]}
</code></pre>
<p>This implementation deals only in <code>$\mathbb{C}$</code>.</p>
<p>Nearly identically, one can treat reversion:</p>
<pre><code>revhyp::{:[z=0;cln(csub(cexp(x);cexp(y))):|
    z=1;csub(x;y):|
    z=2;cdiv(x;y):|
    z=3;cexp(cdiv(cln(x);cln(y)));
    cexp(revhyp(cln(x);cln(y);z-1))]}
</code></pre>
<p>For implementing transaction, one needs to implement exponentiation in
<code>$\mathbb{C}$</code> (for <code>$x, y \in \mathbb{C}$</code>, <code>$x^y=e^{y*\ln(x)}$</code>):</p>
<pre><code>cpow::{cexp(cmul(y;cln(x)))}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, one can turn ones attention to the transaction operation itself:</p>
<pre><code>tranhyp::{:[z=0;cadd(x;cexp(y)):|
    z=1;cmul(x;cexp(y)):|

<h2 id="A_Trivial_Fact_About_Leyland_Numbers"><a class="hanchor" href="#A_Trivial_Fact_About_Leyland_Numbers">A Trivial Fact About Leyland Numbers</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyland_number">Leyland number</a> is a
number <code>$l \in \mathbb{N}^+$</code> so that there exist <code>$a,b \in \mathbb{N}^+ \backslash \{1\}$</code>
so that <code>$n=a^b+b^a$</code>. Does every Leyland number have a unique construction?
That is, for any Leyland number <code>$l$</code>, does there exist four
distinct <code>$a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{N}^+ \backslash \{1\}$</code> so that
<code>$a^b+b^a=c^d+d^c=l$</code>?</p>
<p>This question turns out to be <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/178555/for-integers-a-ge-b-1-is-fa-b-ab-ba-injective#comment447401_178555">very
difficult</a>,
and is unsolved as of now (as far as I know), but one can rule out two
distinct constructions of the same Leyland number with only three numbers:</p>
<p>Let <code>$a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}^+ \backslash \{1\}$</code>, <code>$a \not =b, a \not =c, b \not =c$</code>.
Then <code>$l=a^b+b^a=a^c+c^a$</code>. But since <code>$b$</code> and <code>$c$</code> are distinct,
<code>$b&gt;c$</code> (or the other way around, but that's just semantics). Then
<code>$a^b&gt;a^c$</code>, and <code>$b^a&gt;c^a$</code>, which results in <code>$a^b+b^a&gt;a^c+c^a$</code>. So
distinct constructions with only three numbers are impossible.</p>
<h2 id="Why_Not_NanoApartments"><a class="hanchor" href="#Why_Not_NanoApartments">Why Not Nano-Apartments?</a></h2>
<p>There seem to be goods of many different sizes and price-tags, with
people being able to buy bulk or the bare minimum, e.g. transportation:
walking by foot, biking, public transport, leasing a car, owning a car,
or by helicopter.</p>
<p>However, the very small scale for apartments seems to be neglected –
cheap apartments are often in bad neighbourhoods, with longer commutes and
worse living conditions, but rarely just extremely small (&lt;10 m²). But
one could easily imagine 5 m² apartments, with just a bed &amp; a small
bathroom (or even smaller options with a shared bathroom). However, I
don't know of people renting/buying these kinds of apartments—even
though they might be pretty useful if one wants to trade size against
good location.</p>
<p>Why, therefore, no nano-apartments?</p>
<p>Possible reasons:</p>
<h3 id="No_Supply"><a class="hanchor" href="#No_Supply">No Supply</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps nano-apartments are not economically viable to rent. Maybe
the fixed cost per apartment is so high that it's not worth it below a
certain size—every tenant being an additional burden, plumbing +
upkeep of stairways, organising trash &amp; electricity just isn't worth
it. Or, perhaps, the amount of walls is too big—the more separate
apartments you want to create, the more floor-space is going to be used
on walls to separate those apartments, and at some fixed point around
15 m² it's just not worth it.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that there are regulations dictating the minimal
size of apartments (or something that effectively leads to apartments
having a minimal size).</p>
<h3 id="No_Demand"><a class="hanchor" href="#No_Demand">No Demand</a></h3>
<p>I could be over-estimating the number of people who'd like to live in
such an apartment. I could see myself renting one, especially if the
location is very good—I'm glad to trade off space against having
a short commute. But perhaps I'm very unusual in this regard, and most
people trade off more harshly against the size of the apartment, due to
owning just too much stuff to fit into such a small place.</p>
<p>Or the kinds of people who would make this kind of trade-off just move
into a shared flat, and bare the higher costs (but most rooms in shared
apartments are still larger than 10 m²).</p>
<p>The group of people who would rent those nano-apartments would naturally
be young singles who want to save money and live urban, perhaps that
group is just too small/already served with university dorms?</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://dynomight.net/air/" title="Better air quality is the easiest way not to die">dynomight 2021a</a>,
I decided to replicate their design for the
<a href="https://dynomight.net/better-DIY-air-purifier.html" title="The Cuboid: A DIY air purifier that's better than a box-fan">cuboid</a>
(the <a href="https://dynomight.net/2020/12/15/some-real-data-on-a-DIY-box-fan-air-purifier/" title="Experiments on a $50 DIY air purifier you can make in 30s">cheaper box fan air
purifier</a>
was intolerably violating my æsthetic sensibilities). The
design is, incidentally, very similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsi%E2%80%93Rosenthal_Box">Corsi-Rosenthal
Box</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Materials"><a class="hanchor" href="#Materials">Materials</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>4 filters</li>
<li>1 fan</li>
<li>2 pieces of string</li>
<li>4 pieces of cardboard</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Building_Process"><a class="hanchor" href="#Building_Process">Building Process</a></h3>
<p>First, I arranged the four filters as described in <a href="https://dynomight.net/better-DIY-air-purifier.html" title="The Cuboid: A DIY air purifier that's better than a box-fan">dynomight
2021b</a>
and tied them together using some pieces of string I had lying around
(the bungee cords I had ordered were too short and would have broken
the filters—a lesson in thinking about dependencies! Fortunately
they weren't expensive), with the red rope giving the contraption a nice
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Japanese_bondage">kinbaku</a> æsthetic.</p>
<p><img alt="The filters forming a column, held together by a red and an orange rope" src="./img/cuboid/frontal_no_lid.jpg" title="The filters forming a column, held together by a red and an orange rope"/></p>
<p>I then cut out two pieces of cardboard (<code>$2110 \text{mm} \cdot 2400 \text{mm}$</code>)
that fit right into the column, for stabilization,</p>
<p><img alt="A view into the column, where one can see the upper piece of cardboard inside" src="./img/cuboid/bottom.jpg" title="A view into the column, where one can see the upper piece of cardboard inside"/></p>
<p>and also a piece (<code>$2340 \text{mm} \cdot 2650\text{mm}$</code>) that I could
impishly tape to the bottom of the cuboid ("works for me").</p>
<p><img alt="The bottom of the cuboid, where one piece of cardboard is taped impishly to the filters" src="./img/cuboid/bottom_lid.jpg" title="The bottom of the cuboid, where one piece of cardboard is taped impishly to the filter"/></p>
<p>Next, the fan arrived, so I cut out a lid from some cardboard I got
my <a href="https://queal.com">queal</a> packages in (again <code>$2110 \text{mm} \cdot 2400 \text{mm}$</code>,
as with the bottom), and from that lid I cut a 950mm diameter circle
for the fan.</p>
<p><img alt="Fan, lid, and cut-out" src="./img/cuboid/fan_and_lid.jpg" title="Fan, lid, and cut-out"/></p>
<p>Assembling the cuboid was now easy: Just put the lid on top, put in the
fan, plug in the fan, and voilà:</p>
<p><img alt="The cuboid, seen from the top" src="./img/cuboid/complete_top.jpg" title="The cuboid, seen from the top"/></p>
<p><img alt="The cuboid, seen from the side" src="./img/cuboid/complete.jpg" title="The cuboid, seen from the side"/></p>
<p>My cuboid ~3200mm wide, ~2900mm deep, and ~3900mm high (the knots in
the cords make exact measurement difficult).</p>
<p>Æsthetically, the three different primary colors are a bit much, but
I'm not <em>that</em> bothered by it (although if someone wants to set up a line
of turbo cuboids, all red and black and sleek, sign me up as interested).</p>
<h3 id="Does_it_Work"><a class="hanchor" href="#Does_it_Work">Does it Work?</a></h3>
<p>Probably! I haven't measured air quality yet, but at least it appears
to be sucking the air through the filters:</p>
<p><video controls="" src="./vid/cuboid/it_works.webm" type="video/webm">
The video shows a piece of paper affixed to the cuboid, when I try to move the paper with a pencil, it gets sucked back to the cuboid.
</video></p>
<!--TODO: add tooltip for video-->
<p>I also haven't checked the energy usage yet.</p>
<p>My cuboid is loud enough that I probably won't be running it while I
try to sleep: With a background noise of ~18dB, the cuboid raises that
to ~40dB at 1m horizontal and 0m vertical distance (measured using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamebasic.decibel" title="no affiliation">Sound

<h3 id="Price__Time_Cost"><a class="hanchor" href="#Price__Time_Cost">Price &amp; Time Cost</a></h3>
<p>My cuboid was a bit pricier than the one by dynomight, but not by much:
4 filters, each 23€, the fan  with 38€, and the two bungee cords
for 2€ (I don't count them since I didn't use them in the end): 130€
in total.</p>
<p>It took me a quite a while longer to assemble my cuboid than the alleged
5 minutes: I would estimate that I spent at least 90 minutes one it
(plus another 45 minutes writing this note).</p>
<p>But, all in all, I'm very happy with
my little cuboid. It's humming along to some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Concerto_No._1_(Beethoven)">Beethoven</a>
while I write this.</p>
<h2 id="None"><a class="hanchor" href="#None"><code>scipy.optimize.curve_fit</code> Is Awesome</a></h2>
<p>I recently learned about the python function <code>scipy.optimize.curve_fit</code>,
and I'm really happy I did.</p>
<p>It fulfills a need I didn't know I'd always had, but never
fulfilled: I often have a dataset and a function with some
parameters, and I <em>just want the damn parameters to be fitted
to that dataset, even if imperfectly</em>. Please don't ask any
more annoying questions like “Is the dataset generated by a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Gaussian</a>?”
or “Is the underlying process
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodicity">ergodic</a>?”, just fit the
goddamn curve!</p>
<p>And <code>scipy.optimize.curve_fit</code> does
exactly that! (Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm">Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm</a>,
which minimizes the mean squared error of the predicted values and
the dataset).</p>
<p>You give it a function <code>f</code> with some parameters <code>a, b, c, …</code> and a
dataset consisting of input values <code>x</code> and output values <code>y</code>, and it
then optimizes <code>a, b, c, …</code> so that <code>f(x, a, b, c, …)</code> is as close as
possible to <code>y</code> (where, of course, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> can both be numpy arrays).</p>
<p>This is awesome! I have some datapoints <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and I believe it's
generated by some obscure function, let's say of the form
<code>$f(x, a, b, c)=a \cdot x \cdot sin(b \cdot x + c)$</code>, but I don't know
the exact values for <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>?</p>
<p>No problem! I just throw the whole thing into <code>curve_fit</code>
(<code>scipy.optimize.curve_fit(f, x, y)</code>) and out comes an array of optimal
values for <code>a, b, c</code>!</p>
<p>What if I then want <code>c</code> to be necessarily positive?</p>
<p>Trivial! <code>curve_fit</code> comes with an optional argument called <code>bounds</code>,
since <code>b</code> is the second argument, I call
<code>scipy.optimize.curve_fit(f, x, y, bounds=([-numpy.inf, -numpy.inf, 0], numpy.inf))</code>,
which says that <code>curve_fit</code> should not make the second argument smaller
than zero, but otherwise can do whatever it wants.</p>
<p>So far, I've already used this function
<a href="./range_and_forecasting_accuracy.html#Fitting_a_Logistic_Function">two</a>
<a href="./range_and_forecasting_accuracy.html#Fitting_an_Exponential_Function">times</a>,
and I've only known about it for a week! A must for every wannabe
data-scientist.</p>

        * That gives `$\frac{5 \text{ unskilled labour hours}}{\text{person}} \cdot 3 \cdot 10^8 \text{ persons}=1.5 \cdot 10^8 \text{ unskilled labour hours}$`
        * At `$\frac{5€}{\text{unskilled labor hour}}$` this is ~7.5 bio. €
        * And this is still disregarding increased crash probabilities from higher cognitive load! (Although maybe automatic cars cost more?)

<p>Theorem: The arithmetic mean of logodds is just the geometric mean of odds.</p>
<p>Proof: Let <code>$\mathbf{p}=(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$</code> be a list of probabilities.</p>
<p>Then the arithmetic mean of logodds is <code>$\exp(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}))=\exp(\frac{1}{n} \log(\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{p_i}{1-p_i}))=\exp(\log(\sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{p_i}{1-p_i}}))=\sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{p_i}{1-p_i}}$</code></p>
<p>This is not quite right, though.<!--, maybe TODO solve (although probably
not *that* important, but the inversion isn't quite right).--></p>
<p>But then if the geometric mean is just the 0th generalized mean, and
the arithmetic mean is the 1st generalized mean, are there similarly
variants of the logodds? That is, the odds are the 0th generalized
odds, the logodds are the 1st generalized odds, and there is some 2nd
generalized odds so that the root mean square of the 2nd generalized
odds is the geometric mean of odds?</p>
<p>Would the nth generalized odds just be the <code>$\log^{(n)}$</code>odds?</p>

<h2 id="Was_Software_Security_in_the_Aughts_Exceptionally_Bad"><a class="hanchor" href="#Was_Software_Security_in_the_Aughts_Exceptionally_Bad">Was Software Security in the Aughts Exceptionally Bad?</a></h2>
<p>I remember (from listening to a <a href="https://cre.fm/archiv">bunch of podcasts by German hackers from the mid 00s</a>) a strong vibe that the security of
software systems at the time and earlier was definitely worse than what
would've been optimal for the people making the software (definitely
not safe enough for the users!).</p>
<p>I wonder whether that is (1) true and (if yes) (2) what led to this
happening!</p>
<p>Maybe companies were just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia">myopic</a>
when writing software then, and could've predicted the security problems
but didn't care?</p>
<p>Or was it that the error predicting the importance of security was just
an outlier, that companies and industries on average correctly predict
the importance of safety &amp; security, and this was just a bad draw from
the distribution.</p>
<p>Or is this a common occurrence? Then
one might chalk it up to (1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry">information asymmetries</a>
(normal users don't value the importance of software security,
let alone evaluate the quality of a given piece of software)
or (2) information problems in firms (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/kNANcHLNtJt5qeuSS/p/45mNHCMaZgsvfDXbw">managers had a personal incentive</a> to cut corners on safety).</p>
<p>Another reason might be that lower-level software
usually can make any security issues a reputational
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externality</a>
for end-user software: sure, in the end Intel's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor">branch predictor</a> is

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wik/Spectre">Spectre</a>, and for setting cache
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timeouts</a> too high that
we can nicely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer">rowhammer.js</a>
it out, but what end-user will blame Intel and not "and then Chrome
crashed and they wanted my money".</p>
<p>This is, of course, in the context of the development of AI, and the
common argument that "companies will care about single-single alignment".</p>
<p>The possible counterexample of software security engineering until the
mid 00s seemed like a good test case to me, but on reflection I'm now
not so sure anymore.</p>
<p>There are some reasons to believe that these podcasts are not
evidence for low investment in security being a bad decision
at the time: In my experience, most people in the European
hacker scene are technically excellent, but have a surprisingly
poor understanding of economics and what constraints running a
business entails, as well as being quite left wing and therefore
<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/politics-is-the-mind-killer">mind-killed</a>
with respect to software companies. Their job depends on demand
for security experts, so they have an additional incentive to
make security sound important &amp; neglected, and finally software
security people I have met have no sense of proportion ("What,

<p>In his book <a href="https://equilibriabook.com/">Inadequate Equilibria</a>, Eliezer
Yudkowsky introduces the concept of an inadequate equilibrium: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash
equilibrium</a> in a game
where at least one Nash equilibrium with a larger payoff exists.</p>
<p>One can then formalize the badness of an
inadequate equilibrium <code>$e$</code> similarly to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_anarchy">Price of
Anarchy</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_Stability">Price
of Stability</a>:</p>
<div>
    $$\text{PoI(G, e)}=\frac{\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)}{\sum_{i \in N} u_i(e)}$$
</div>
<p>where <code>$\text{NE}(G)$</code> is the set of all Nash equilibria for the game
<code>$G$</code> and <code>$N$</code> is the set of all players.</p>
<p>The bound for the badness of any inadequate equilibrium is then given by</p>
<div>
    $$\text{PoI(G)}=\frac{\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)}{\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{min}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)}$$
</div>
<p>This formalization has the problem of being sensitive to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation">affine
transformations</a>
of <code>$u$</code> and becoming undefined if the worst Nash equilibrium (or the
current Nash equilibrium) has payoff zero.</p>
<p>A slightly nicer formalization could be to define:</p>
<div>
    $$\text{PoI(G)}=\\
    \text{PoA}(G)-\text{PoS}(G)=\\
    \frac{\underset{s \in S}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)} {\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{min}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)}-\frac{\underset{s \in S}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)} {\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)}$$
</div>
<p>Since we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Price_of_Anarchy#Mathematical_Definition">know
that</a>
<code>$1 \le \text{PoS} \le \text{PoA}$</code>, under this definition <code>$\text{PoI} \ge 0$</code>.</p>
<p>Is this definition insensitive to positive affine transformations? I am
not sure, but I have the intuition that it is, since</p>
<div>
    $$\frac{\underset{s \in S}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} α \cdot u_i(s)+β} {\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{min}} \sum_{i \in N} α \cdot u_i(s)+β}-\frac{\underset{s \in S}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} α \cdot u_i(s)+β} {\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} α \cdot u_i(s)+β}=\\
    \frac{\underset{s \in S}{\text{max }} αβN + α \cdot \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)} {\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{min }} αβN + α \cdot \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)}-\frac{\underset{s \in S}{\text{max }} αβN + α \cdot \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)} {\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{max }} αβN + α \cdot \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)}=\\
    \frac{\underset{s \in S}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)} {\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{min}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)}-\frac{\underset{s \in S}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)} {\underset{s \in \text{NE}(G)}{\text{max}} \sum_{i \in N} u_i(s)}$$
</div>
<p>iff one can just pull coefficients out of a maximization/minimization
like that. Not sure though. (Negative affine transformations would flip
the function and select other points as maxima/minima).</p>
<p>If one can bound the price of anarchy and the price of stability, one
can also sometimes establish bounds on the price of inadequacy:</p>
<table>

<th>Upper-bound:  <code>$1 \le \text{PoA} \le n$</code></th>
<th>Lower-bound: <code>$\text{PoA} \ge n$</code></th>

<!--TODO: hunt down cryptonormativities in here, destroy them-->
<p>In a recent episode of <a href="https://thefilancabinet.com/episodes/2023/02/05/6-oliver-habryka.html">The Filan
Cabinet</a>,
Oliver Habryka elaborated on a very interesting social pattern: If you
have a community with high status people, and try to introduce clearer
metrics of performance into that community, high status individuals in
the community will strongly resist those metrics because they have an
asymmetric downside: If they perform well on the metric, they stay in
their position, but if they perform poorly, they might lose status. Since
they are at least a little bit unsure about their performance on the
metric relative to others, they can only lose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daniel Filan: So let's go back to what you think on your bad days. So
you mentioned that you had this sense that lots of things in the world
were, I don't know, trying to distract you from things that are true or
important. And that LessWrong did that somewhat less.  </p>
<p>Oliver Habryka: Yeah.  </p>
<p>Daniel Filan: Can you kind of flesh that out? What kinds of things
are you thinking of?  </p>
<p>Oliver Habryka: I mean, the central dimension that I would often
think about here is reputation management. As an example, the medical
profession, which, you know, generally has the primary job of helping
you with your medical problems and trying to heal you of diseases and
various other things, also, at the same time, seems to have a very strong
norm of mutual reputation protection. Where, if you try to run a study
trying to figure out which doctors in the hospital are better or worse
than other doctors in the hospital, quite quickly, the hospital will
close its ranks and be like, “Sorry, we cannot gather data on [which
doctors are better than the other doctors in this hospital].” Because
that would, like, threaten the reputation arrangement we have. This would
introduce additional data that might cause some of us to be judged and
some others of us to not be judged.  </p>
<p>And my sense is the way that usually looks like from the inside is
an actual intentional blinding to performance metrics in order to both
maintain a sense of social peace, and often the case because... <strong>A very
common pattern here [is] something like, you have a status hierarchy
within a community or a local institution like a hospital. And generally,
that status hierarchy, because of the way it works, has leadership
of the status hierarchy be opposed to all changes to the status
hierarchy. Because the current leadership is at the top of the status
hierarchy, and so almost anything that we introduce into the system that
involves changes to that hierarchy is a threat, and there isn't much to
be gained, [at least in] the zero-sum status conflict that is present.</strong> </p>
<p>And so my sense is, when you try to run these studies about comparative
doctor performance, what happens is more that there's an existing status
hierarchy, and lots of people feel a sense of uneasiness and a sense
of wanting to protect the status quo, and therefore they push back on
gathering relevant data here. And from the inside this often looks like
an aversion to trying to understand what are actually the things that
cause different doctors to be better than other doctors. Which is crazy,
if you're, like, what is the primary job of a good medical institution
and a good medical profession, it would be figuring out what makes people
be better doctors and worse doctors. But [there are] all of the social
dynamics that tend to be present in lots of different institutions that
make it so that looking at relative performance [metrics] becomes a
quite taboo topic and a topic that is quite scary.  </p>
<p>So that's one way [in which] I think many places try to actively... Many
groups of people, when they try to orient and gather around a certain
purpose, actually [have a harder time] or get blinded or in some sense
get integrated into a hierarchy that makes it harder for them to look
at a thing that they were originally interested in when joining the
institution.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis">Ignaz Semmelweis</a>
studied the maternal mortality rate due to puerperal fever in two
different hospitals in the Vienna of the mid 19th century. Finding a
stark difference in mortality rates between the two clinics (10% and
4%), he pursued different theories, finally concluding that the medical
students and doctors in the first clinic did not wash their hands even
after autopsies, while the midwives in the second clinic did not have
contact with corpses. He instituted a policy of first desinfecting hands
with a chlorinated solution and later simple handwashing, leading to
drastic declines in the mortality rate.</p>
<p>However, Semmelweis was derided for his ideas, and they were dismissed
as out of line with the then common four humors theory. Additionally, Wikipedia states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result, his ideas were rejected by the medical community. Other,
more subtle, factors may also have played a role. Some doctors,
for instance, were offended at the suggestion that they should
wash their hands, feeling that their social status as gentlemen
was inconsistent with the idea that their hands could be
unclean.<sup>[19]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis#cite_note-30">[F]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>János Diescher was appointed Semmelweis's successor at the Pest
University maternity clinic. Immediately, mortality rates increased
sixfold to 6%, but the physicians of Budapest said nothing; there were
no inquiries and no protests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite surprising to me that we still know these numbers.</p>
<h4 id="Intellectuals_Resist_IQ"><a class="hanchor" href="#Intellectuals_Resist_IQ">Intellectuals Resist IQ</a></h4>
<p>Another example is that (arguendo) many intellectuals
place an absurdly high amount of rigor on any attempts to
develop tests for <em>g</em>, and the widespread <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/14/beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor/">isolated demands for

(and probably thereby creating more polarization),
and the large number of voting method criteria <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting#Voting_method_criteria">it
violates</a>.</p>
<p>Here, again, the groups with large amounts of power have an incentive to
prevent better methods of measurement coming into place: in a two-party
system, both parties don't want additional competitors (i.e. third
parties) to have a better shot at coming into power, which would be the
case with better voting methods—so both parties don't undertake any
steps to switch to a better system (and might even attempt to hinder or
stop such efforts).</p>
<p>If this is true, then it's a display that high status actors not only
resist quantification of performance, but also improvements in the
existing metrics for performance.</p>

<p>It is common for big projects to take more effort and time to complete
than initially estimated. For software projects, there exist several
companies who act as consultants to estimate the effort and time
required for completing software projects. However, none of those
companies publish track records of their forecasting ability (in
line with the surprising general lack of customers demanding <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2006/12/the_80_forecast.html">track
records</a>
of performance).</p>
<p>This is a somewhat noncentral case, because the development effort
estimation companies and consultancies are probably not high status
relative to their customers, but perhaps the most well-regarded of such
companies have found a way to coordinate around making track records
low status.</p>

<h2 id="Subscripts_for_Probabilities"><a class="hanchor" href="#Subscripts_for_Probabilities">Subscripts for Probabilities</a></h2>
<p>Gwern has wondered about a use-case for subscripts in hypertext. While
they have settled on a specific use-case, namely <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Subscripts.html">years for
citations</a>, I propose a different one:
reporting explicit probabilities.</p>
<p>Explicitely giving for probabilities in day-to-day English text is usually
quite clunky: "I assign 35% to North Korea testing an intercontinental
ballistic missile until the end of this year" reads far less smoothly
than "I don't think North Korea will test an intercontinental ballistic
missile this year".<!--TODO: what's the normal English problem with
multiple statements?--></p>
<p>And since subscripts are a solution in need of a problem, one can wonder
how well those two fit together: Quite well, I claim.</p>
<p>In short, I propose to append probabilities in subscript after a statement
using standard HTML subscript notation (or <code>$\LaTeX$</code> as a fallback if
it's available), with the probability possibly also being a link to a
relevant forecasting platform with the same question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think Donald Trump is going to be incarcerated before 2030<sub><a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/10832/donald-trump-jailed-by-2030/">65%</a></sub>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>almost</em> as readable as the sentence without the probability.</p>
<p>There are some complications with negations in sentences or multiple
statements. For the most part, I'll simply avoid such cases ("Doctor,
it hurts when I do this!" "Don't do that, then."), but if I had to,
I'd solve the first problem by declaring that the probability applies to
the literal meaning of the previous sentence, including all negations;
the problem with multiple statements is solved by delimiters.</p>
<p>As an example for the different kinds of negation: "The train won't
come more than 5 minutes late<sub>90%</sub>" would (arguendo) mean the
same thing as "I don't think the train will come more than 5 minutes
late<sub>90%</sub>" means the same as "The train will take more than 5
minutes to arrive<sub>10%</sub>" equivalent to "I assign 90% probability
to the train arriving within the next 5 minutes".</p>
<p>With multiple statements, my favorite way of delimiting is currently
half brackets: "I think ⸤it'll rain tomorrow⸥<sub>55%</sub>, but
⸤Tuesday is going to be sunny⸥<sub>80%</sub>, but I don't think
⸤your uncle is going to be happy about that⸥<sub>15%</sub>."</p>
<p>The probabilities in this context aren't quite
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidentiality">evidentials</a>, but neither
are they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veridicality">veridicals</a> nor
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wik/Mirativity">miratives</a>, I propose the world
"credal" for this category.</p>
<h3 id="Enumerating_Possible_Notations"><a class="hanchor" href="#Enumerating_Possible_Notations">Enumerating Possible Notations</a></h3>
<p>The exact place of insertion is subtle: In sentences with a
single central statement, there are multiple locations one could place
the probability.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the verb related to belief: "I think<sub>55%</sub> it'll rain tomorrow."
<ul>
<li>Advantage: Close to the word relating to the belief (which could reflect the strength of belief in itself, using "guess"/"wager"/"think"/"believe").</li>
<li>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Conflicts with assigning probabilities to multiple statements.</li>
<li>Puts visual clutter before the statement in question.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>At the end of the statement: "I think it'll rain tomorrow<sub>55%</sub>."
<ul>
<li>Advantages:
<ul>
<li>Allows assigning probabilities to simple statements ("It'll rain tomorrow<sub>55%</sub>") and to multiple statements (see below).</li>
<li>Allows distinguishing the beliefs of different people. "I think<sub>55%</sub> it'll rain tomorrow, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%BA_Chulainn">Cú Chulainn</a> disagrees<sub>22%</sub>."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disadvantage: If the probability is intended to contextualise the statement, this context is weaker if it is introduced <em>after</em> the statement in question.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At the subject of the sentence: "I<sub>55%</sub> think it'll rain tomorrow."
<ul>
<li>Advantage: This can be used to distinguish the beliefs of different people. "I<sub>55%</sub> think it'll rain tomorrow, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%BA_Chulainn">Cú Chulainn</a><sub>22%</sub> is skeptical about it."</li>
<li>Disadvantage: Putting the probability before the statement the probability is about feels quite unnatural.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This becomes trickier in sentences with multiple statements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Probabilities after each subclaim: "I think it'll rain tomorrow<sub>55%</sub>, but Tuesday is going to be sunny<sub>80%</sub>, but I don't think your uncle is going to be happy about that<sub>15%</sub>.
<ul>
<li>Adding in delimiters to denote a specific subclaim the probability is about. I wonder whether there are better unicode characters for this, corner brackets might be a good candidate.
<ul>
<li>Lower <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_Bracket">half brackets</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Quine_corners_%E2%8C%9C%E2%8C%9D_and_half_brackets_%E2%B8%A4_%E2%B8%A5_or_%E2%B8%A2_%E2%B8%A3">Quine corners</a> which look almost the same): "I think ⸤it'll rain tomorrow⸥<sub>55%</sub>, but ⸤Tuesday is going to be sunny⸥<sub>80%</sub>, but I don't think ⸤your uncle is going to be happy about that⸥<sub>15%</sub>."</li>
<li>Upper half brackets to the left, lower half brackets to the right: "I think ⸢it'll rain tomorrow⸥<sub>55%</sub>, but ⸢Tuesday is going to be sunny⸥<sub>80%</sub>, but I don't think ⸢your uncle is going to be happy about that⸥<sub>15%</sub>."</li>
<li>Subscripted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthesis">parentheses</a>: "I think <sub>(</sub>it'll rain tomorrow<sub>)</sub><sub>55%</sub>, but <sub>(</sub>Tuesday is going to be sunny<sub>)</sub><sub>80%</sub>, but I don't think <sub>(</sub>your uncle is going to be happy about that<sub>)</sub><sub>15%</sub>."</li>
<li>Subscripted half <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet">guillemets</a>: "I think <sub>‹</sub>it'll rain tomorrow<sub>›</sub><sub>55%</sub>, but <sub>‹</sub>Tuesday is going to be sunny<sub>›</sub><sub>80%</sub>, but I don't think <sub>‹</sub>your uncle is going to be happy about that<sub>›</sub><sub>15%</sub>."</li>
<li>And subscripted full guillemets: "I think <sub>«</sub>it'll rain tomorrow<sub>»</sub><sub>55%</sub>, but <sub>«</sub>Tuesday is going to be sunny<sub>»</sub><sub>80%</sub>, but I don't think <sub>«</sub>your uncle is going to be happy about that<sub>»</sub><sub>15%</sub>."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>I basically rule out lists of probabilities after the verb relating to each subclaim, as it's very mentally taxing to relate each probability to each claim:
<ul>
<li>"I think<sub>55%, 80%, 15%</sub> ⸤it'll rain tomorrow⸥, but ⸤Tuesday is going to be sunny⸥, but I don't think ⸤your uncle is going to be happy about that⸥.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the people writing the text
reporting probabilities are probably <a href="./doc/cs/ai/alignment/agent_foundations/embedded_agency_demski_garrabrant_2020.pdf">logically
non-omniscient</a>
<a href="https://arbital.com/p/bounded_agent/">bounded agents</a>, it might as
well be useful to report the time or effort one has spent on refining
the reported probability: "I reckon humanity will survive the 21st
century<sub>55%:20h</sub>", indicating that the speaker has reflected
on this question for 20 hours to arrive at their current probability
(something akin to reporting an "epistemic effort" for a piece of
information). I fear that this notation is getting into cumbersome
territory and won't be using it.</p>
<h3 id="Notation_Options_and_Difficulties"><a class="hanchor" href="#Notation_Options_and_Difficulties">Notation Options and Difficulties</a></h3>
<p>There are three available options: Either ones writing platform supports
HTML, in which case one can use the <code>&lt;sub&gt;18%&lt;/sub&gt;</code> tags (giving
<sub>18%</sub>), or it supports <code>$\LaTeX$</code>, which creates a sligthly
fancier looking but also more fragile notation using <code>_{18\%}</code> (resulting
in <code>$_{18\%}$</code>), or ones platform directly supports subscripting, such
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoc">pandoc</a> with <code>~18%~</code>, but not
Reddit Markdown (which <em>does</em> support superscript). More info about other
platforms <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Subscripts.html#technical-support">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ideally one would simply use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wik/Unicode_subscripts">Unicode
subscripts</a>, which are
available for all digits, but tragically not for the percentage sign
'%' or a simple dot '.'. Perhaps a project for the future: After all,
they did include a subscript '+'₊, a subscript '-'₋, equality sign
'='₌ and parentheses '()'₍₎, but many subscript letters (b, c, d,
f, g, j, q, r, u, v, w, y and z) are still missing…</p>

It's cool if you tell me the equations for computing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function">likelihood ratio</a> of a hypothesis &amp; dataset, but it's even cooler if you give me some sample code I can use and extend along with it.</li>

<p>If <code>decompose</code> can't find a solution to the given preferences, it returns
a vector of 0s as a default result.</p>
<p>The input for <code>hodgerank</code> is a dictionary of preferences, where the
keys are the options and the preferences are arrays of the same size,
empty answers being designated as <code>np.nan</code>. The output is a dictionary
with the options as keys and the corresponding HodgeRank values.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; prefs1={0:np.array([5,3]),1:np.array([4,5]),2:np.array([3, np.nan]),3:np.array([5,2])}
&gt;&gt;&gt; hodgerank(prefs1)
{0: 0.4642857142857137, 1: 0.7499999999999991, 2: -1.2499999999999987, 3: 0.0357142857142852}

&gt;&gt;&gt; prefs2={0:np.array([5,3]),1:np.array([4,5]),2:np.array([3, 1]),3:np.array([5,2])}
&gt;&gt;&gt; hodgerank(prefs2)

</code></pre>
<p><code>prefs2</code> is an interesting case: We know from
<a href=".doc/preference/statistical_ranking_and_combinatorial_hodge_theory_jiang_et_al_2011.pdf" title="Statistical ranking and combinatorial Hodge theory">Jiang et al.
2011</a>
that if the preferences are all complete, then HodgeRank is equivalent
to the sum of values under some linear transformation. That linear
transformation here is <code>$(x \cdot 2)+7$</code>, and yields the values
<code>{0: 8, 1: 9, 2: 4, 3: 7}</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; prefs3={0:np.array([4,np.nan,3]),1:np.array([3,4,np.nan]),2:np.array([np.nan, 3,4])}
&gt;&gt;&gt; hodgerank(prefs3)
{0: 0.0, 1: 1.3877787807814457e-17, 2: 0.0}

&gt;&gt;&gt; prefs4={0:np.array([5,np.nan,3]),1:np.array([3,4,np.nan]),2:np.array([np.nan, 3,4])}
&gt;&gt;&gt; hodgerank(prefs4)

</code></pre>
<p>Going from <code>prefs3</code> to <code>prefs4</code> shows that HodgeRank can be manipulated
by the first voter: they simply increase their score of the first option
(which they like most anyway) and thereby make it the highest ranking
option in the global ranking.</p>

<h2 id="KaldorHicks_Worsenings"><a class="hanchor" href="#KaldorHicks_Worsenings">Kaldor-Hicks Worsenings</a></h2>
<p>There are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto-improvements</a>:
everyone is made better (or equally well) off by their own
standards. There are, similarly, Pareto-worsenings: Everyone is made
<em>worse</em> off by their own standard, or their welfare is unchanged.</p>
<p>Then there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaldor-Hicks_efficiency">Kaldor-Hicks
improvements</a>,
which happen if one e.g. reallocates the available goods so that
the better-off could compensate the now worse-off to create a Pareto
improvement. This compensation need not occur, it needs to be merely
possible.</p>
<p>Now can there be a Kaldor-Hicks-<em>worsening</em>?</p>
<p>The naive version (everyone is worse (or equally well) off, and there
is no way of making a single person better off through redistribution)
seems too strong, there is probably always a redistribution that gives
the available resources to a single agent.</p>
<p>A simple negation of the criteria then perhaps makes more sense: A
change is a Kaldor-Hicks-worsening if and only if everyone is worse (or
equally well) off and there is no way of creating a Pareto-improvement
through reallocation.</p>
<p>This implies a anti-Kaldor-Hicks-worsening: A change makes everyone worse
off, <em>but</em> there is some reallocation that creates a Pareto improvement.</p>
<p>Example: We have a Sadist and a Masochist. The Masochist starts hurting
the Sadist, thus creating opportunity cost for them both. Switching the
roles creates a Pareto improvement.</p>
<h2 id="Does_Recent_Masturbation_Decrease_Meditation_Quality"><a class="hanchor" href="#Does_Recent_Masturbation_Decrease_Meditation_Quality">Does Recent Masturbation Decrease Meditation Quality?</a></h2>
<p>Probably not<sub>75%</sub>.<!--TODO: image of dril tweet?--> Correlations
between meditation quality and time since last masturbation are generally
&lt;0.1, and sometimes negative.</p>
<p>There is some received wisdom that ejaculation and masturbation
in particular decreases meditation quality: The retreats of
<a href="http://www.dhamma.org/en/">dhamma.org</a> in the tradition of S.N. Goenka
forbid any sexual activity, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoist_sexual_practices#Male_control_of_ejaculation">Taoist sexual practices recommend semen
retention</a>.
Since I track both <a href="./data.html#Meditation">my meditations</a> and
<a href="./data.html#Masturbation">(a.m.a.b.) masturbations</a>, I can check whether
this is observationally true. Of course results from observational data
can be due to confounders, but such results are more valuable than pure
speculation, and may point to possible experimental investigations.</p>
<p>First, I load both meditation data and masturbation data (using my
loading code from <a href="./code/experiments/load.py">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; meditations=get_meditations()
&gt;&gt;&gt; masturbations=get_masturbations()
</code></pre>
<p>Since I only started tracking my masturbations on 2021-01-15, I have to
filter out all meditation I did before that:</p>
<pre><code>tohu=masturbations['datetime'].min()
meditations=meditations.loc[meditations['meditation_start']&gt;tohu]
</code></pre>
<p>And then I merge <code>meditations</code> and <code>masturbations</code> so that each meditation
is relation to the masturbation last before it:</p>
<pre><code>meditations=meditations.sort_values('meditation_start')
masturbations=masturbations.sort_values('datetime')
combined=pd.merge_asof(meditations, masturbations, left_on='meditation_start', right_on='datetime', direction='backward')
combined['diff']=combined['meditation_start']-combined['datetime']
</code></pre>
<p>All hail <code>merge_asof</code>!<!--TOOO: meme with Elmo?--></p>
<p>Just to check whether the difference computed is the right one, I do a
quick sanity check:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; combined['diff'].describe()
count                         1462
mean     3 days 21:46:44.564929548

75%         3 days 14:14:14.750500
max        39 days 09:24:06.877000
Name: diff, dtype: object
</code></pre>
<p>And now I can simply compute the correlation with time since last
masturbation and concentration &amp; mindfulness during meditation:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; combined[['mindfulness_rating', 'concentration_rating', 'diff']].corr(numeric_only=False)
                      mindfulness_rating  concentration_rating      diff
mindfulness_rating              1.000000              0.687853  0.088458

</code></pre>
<p>As one can see, the correlation between time since last masturbation
and concentration/mindfulness are weak and contradictory, and I
weakly conclude that masturbation does not influence meditation quality
noticeably in practice regimes like mine. One might criticize my analysis
for not including periods of long abstinence from ejaculation, which
I guess is fair. So we can simply restrict the dataset to meditations
4 or more days after the last masturbation. We still have n=329, which
is appreciable.</p>

<p>The correlation of ≅0.17 of abstinence-time with concentration is
still not strong enough to convince me, but perhaps points in some
interesting direction.</p>

<h2 id="Two_Reasons_For_Restarting_the_Testing_of_Nuclear_Weapons"><a class="hanchor" href="#Two_Reasons_For_Restarting_the_Testing_of_Nuclear_Weapons">Two Reasons For Restarting the Testing of Nuclear Weapons</a></h2>
<p>Nuclear testing was largely phased
out by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-Ban_Treaty">Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty</a>
in 1996, with the exception of non-signatories like India, Pakistan (both
last testing weapons in 1998) and North Korea (tests during the 2010s).</p>
<p>I see two arguments in favor of restarting some limited nuclear tests,
and a couple of weak counter-arguments.</p>
<p>Reinstating such tests would include public announcement of their time &amp;
place, with penalties for unannounced tests.</p>
<p>Arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Testing of warning systems</strong>: Early warning systems malfunctioning
present a large risk of normal events being mistaken as attacks, with
correspoding nuclear counter-attacks. Reading through the <a href="https://futureoflife.org/resource/nuclear-close-calls-a-timeline/">FLI Close Calls
Timeline</a>,
I identify 7/28 events as being clear examples of malfunctioning early
detection systems as causes for close calls (e.g. "Lost Contact with 50
Missiles", "Six Mis-Routed Nukes", "Soviets Misinterpret US Nuclear War
Games" (which would be much easier under a setup where announced military
testing was expected and acceptable), and "False Alarm During DEFCON 3")
and 6/28 more as being at least linked to detection systems malfunctioning
("Norwegian Rocket Mistaken for ICBM", "Soviet Union Detects Incoming
Missiles", "Faulty Chip Signals Soviet Attack", "Power Failure Mistaken
for Nuclear Blasts", "Missiles over Georgia"). However, there is at least
one case in which a test was perceived as an attack ("Soviet Missile
Headed Toward US?") — could this one have been avoided if announcing
nuclear tests was common? Additionally, some false alarms (e.g. "Tampa
is getting nuked") result from participants mistaking training tapes for
real attacks, which would not happen as much in the case of real-world
tests. Having real-world nuclear tests occurring regularly might be a
time to test early detection systems and thereby guard against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives">false
positives</a>
by increasing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity">specificity</a>
of early detection systems, thereby lowering the risk of accidental
escalation based on faulty information. My best guess is that operators of
those early warning systems are very uncertain about their reliability,
and would become significantly more relaxed if they had real-world
information to calibrate on.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing redundancy</strong>: Similarly, unless
covert nuclear testing is occurring (which I
consider unlikely<sub>10%</sub>, given the related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-Ban_Treaty#Monitoring">intensive
monitoring</a>),
I expect there to be significant uncertainty in the military commands of
nuclear states about the reliability of those weapons, with conservatism
about the reliability of those weapons leading to larger stockpiles ("If
we don't know whether our weapons work, it's probably better to make more
&amp; different ones."). This uncertainty probably leads to an effective
number of nuclear weapons that is larger than strictly necessary for
military purposes, and has large negative externalities—the weapons
would probably still be used in a nuclear conflict. Nuclear testing
could reduce this uncertainty about the reliability of the weapons,
making reductions in stockpiles more realistic. If I imagine having to
rely on weapons that haven't been tested in more than 30 years, I'd also
want to err on having more of those weapons rather than less.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The reduction brought challenges: if the U.S. could no longer build
or design the next world-altering bomb, what could government officials
do to retain the expertise of scientists? And how would the ensure the
integrity of the arsenal without being able to test the products? Nuclear
bombs contain more than 4,000 parts, and most of those parts are now
more than 30 years old. Ask yourself: If you left a 1993 Ford Mustang
in the barn—a temperature-controlled vault of a barn, but a barn
nonetheless—would you feel 100% certain that everything would work
properly when you turned the ignition? Oh, and don’t forget that your
life may depend on it.<br/>
The answer the Energy Department came up with was to harness computer
simulations and experiments to evaluate the reliability—and extend the
life spans of—America’s nuclear weapons. The most vexing dilemma was
assessing plutonium, an element only discovered 80 years ago. To find
out how it ages, Los Alamos ran experiments in the early 2000s that
found plutonium pits changed over the years in ways that could impact
weapons’ performance. But the studies couldn’t provide specifics on
when exactly plutonium aged out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>—W. J. Hennigan, <a href="https://time.com/6296743/los-alamos-lab-plutonium-pits-nuclear-weapons/">“In the Lab Oppenheimer Built, the U.S. Is Building Nuclear Bomb Cores Again”</a>, 2023</em></p>
<p>There are some counterarguments to restarting the testing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tests as cover for attack</strong>: More tests would mean that countries
could mistake tests as attacks, or tests be used as a plausibly deniable
scenario in which to strike first (perhaps even masking the attack as
an accident). This risk could be strongly reduced by requiring public
announcements of the tests e.g. a month ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental impact</strong>: Wikipedia
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_testing#Compensation_for_victims">states</a>
that nuclear fallout has lead to an excess of ~11,000 deaths due to
nuclear radiation. Resuming (restricted) nuclear tests would likely have
similarly high externalities—could these perhaps be mitigated in some
way, such as testing in very remote (internationally shared?) locations,
such as the Antarctic?</li>
<li><strong>Making more powerful weapons</strong>: Nuclear tests might enable
the development of even more powerful nuclear weapons. I'm not sure
how bottle-necked the development of bombs with higher yields is on
experimental data: the reason I know about the limit of the size of
nuclear weapons is that "there is no target big enough to be hit by them".
If this is not true, then more destructive nuclear weapons developed
using experimental data would be negative for the world. (Relatedly,
I'm not sure whether, if nuclear testing allow for weapons with higher
precision, that would be good or bad for the world: nuclear strikes would
have fewer externalities, but leaders might also be more willing to use
nuclear strikes due to lower civilian casualties (and thereby increasing
the risk of nuclear escalation)).</li>

<h2 id="None_1"><a class="hanchor" href="#None_1">Ordering Outgoing <em>and</em> Incoming Edges in Dot</a></h2>
<p>Let's say you have a graph like this, drawn by the <code>dot</code> program:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
    c-&gt;a
    d-&gt;c [color="red"]
    c-&gt;b
    b-&gt;d
    a-&gt;d
}
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/incoming/example_wrong.png"/></p>
<p>but you want to move the red edge to the middle. In this particular
example, you <em>could</em> use <code>circo</code> and make the graph more circular,
but that pattern fails with more complicated graphs, especially when
you want specific edges to be on top or at the bottom (e.g. when each
edge in the example graph is replaced by an edge, a node and another
edge). Neither do edge-weighting, subgraphs or ordering of nodes work.</p>
<p>The best solution I've found is to add an invisible further edge <code>c-&gt;d</code>:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
    c-&gt;a
    d-&gt;c [color="red"]
    c-&gt;d [color="white"]
    c-&gt;b
    b-&gt;d
    a-&gt;d
}
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/incoming/example_right.png"/></p>
<p>The result looks slightly wonky. but works. If one wants more assurances,
one can also add the line <code>{ordering=out; c};</code> to make it more likely
that the red edge isn't just banished to the side.</p>

<p>Since PredictionBook is shutting down, I thought it'd be good to
<code>wget</code> the site and make a static archive available. It is available
<a href="./doc/misc/predictionbook.com.tar.gz">here</a>, and can be extracted via
<code>tar -xzf predictionbook.com.tar.gz</code>.</p>
<h2 id="Downloading_a_Substack_Podcast_by_Hand"><a class="hanchor" href="#Downloading_a_Substack_Podcast_by_Hand">Downloading a Substack Podcast by Hand</a></h2>
<p>To my surprise, <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp"><code>yt-dlp</code></a> can't
download <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack">Substack</a> podcasts. But
they <em>can</em> be downloaded with a little bit of effort by hand.</p>
<p>Let's take <a href="https://uncoiling.substack.com/p/romeo-stevens-an-orientation-to-practice-part-1">this podcast
episode</a>
as an example. Inspecting the audio player, we can find the following HTML block:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;audio src="/api/v1/audio/upload/3b5196e4-3c8e-40aa-b1a2-d334923ca874/src"&gt;Audio playback is not supported on your browser. Please upgrade.&lt;/audio&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So we can simply plug the source in
after the global substack domain, which gets us
<a href="https://substack.com/api/v1/audio/upload/3b5196e4-3c8e-40aa-b1a2-d334923ca874/src">https://substack.com/api/v1/audio/upload/3b5196e4-3c8e-40aa-b1a2-d334923ca874/src</a>.
Calling that address starts the download process automatically.</p>
<p>Adding the download functionality to <code>yt-dlp</code> is on my todo list.</p>

<p>The most fleshed-out model of AI takeoff is <a href="https://niplav.site/doc/cs/ai/alignment/takeoff/a_compute_centric_framework_of_takeoff_speeds_davidson_2023.pdf">Davidson
2023</a>,
which makes the median prediction of 20% automation to 100% automation
in ~3 years (10th percentile: 0.8 years, 90th percentile: 12.5 years).</p>
<p>Along the axes of {fast, slow}×{continuous, discountinuous}, that feels
quite fast to me, even if it isn't very discountinuous.</p>
<p>The other reasons make me move towards "but it might be a lot faster
than that". One reason is that the Davidson model assumes that the human
brain performs 10¹⁵ FLOP/s, and that the AI systems will be at most
that efficient or slightly less efficient. So most of my disagreement
is around <em>how much the ceiling of cognitive algorithms is above humans</em>.</p>
<p>One reason is that human brains don't seem like the optimal substrate
for performing cognition: Warm &amp; wet, very low information transmission
speed (signals on neurons are limited to at most 200 m/s)—and still
they are incredibly sample-efficient!</p>
<p>Then there's the <em>power of error-corrected computation</em>: Digital
computers can make very long inferences in discrete domains without
problems, and when I introspect, I have the strong intuition that
my system 2 tries to approximate this, especially when trying to
enumerate options in a decision, recursively decompose a plan into
its components, perform abstraction (while caching which parts of the
abstraction are tight and which are leaky)—but my system 2 only has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">7±2</a>
(or maybe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Memory#Capacity">actually just
4</a>?) usable
slots. And unless the limit is due to combinatorial explosion (which
might be handleable by careful pruning, or prioritized search), AI
systems could have larger (perhaps vastly larger?) working memories.</p>
<p>The standard rejoinder here is that evolution has optimized human brains
really really hard, and our current technology is usually 2-6 orders of
magnitude worse than what evolution has come up with. But if we believe
that error-corrected computation is quite rare in biology, then this opens
up a new niche to make progress in, similar to how there are no plants
in space because they couldn't evolve rocket-like tech and transparent
shells that were resistant enough in vacuum.</p>
<p>This points at an intuition I have: There is a bunch of α left in
combining error-corrected/discrete computation (which computers are good
at) with error-resistant/continuous computation (à la neural networks
or brains). And especially if I think about cognition through the lens of
algorithms, it feels like there's a <em>deep mine of algorithms</em>: The space
of possible algorithms is vast, and even in <em>very</em> simple problem domains
we have found surprising innovations (such as going from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm">Karatsuba
algorithm</a>
to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhage-Strassen_algorithm">Schönhage-Strassen
algorithm</a>,
or from the naive algorithm for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_Subarray_problem">maximum subarray
problem</a>
to Kadane's algorithm)). My "optimism" here has been hindered
somewhat by some evidence on how well <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/J6gktpSgYoyq5q3Au/benchmarking-an-old-chess-engine-on-new-hardware">old chess algorithms perform on new
hardware</a>,
and the observation that the surprising algorithms we find
are usually galactic (such as in the case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_matrix_multiplication#Matrix_multiplication_exponent">slowly
shrinking best-case exponent in the computational complexity of matrix
multiplication</a>—where
yet we still only use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen's_algorithm">Strassen's
algorithm</a>.</p>
