<h3 id="AnarchoCapitalism"><a class="hanchor" href="#AnarchoCapitalism">"Anarcho-Capitalism"</a></h3>
<p>The word "Anarchism" is strongly connected with left libertarian
anti-capitalist thought (such as described by Bakunin, Kropotkin and
Proudhon) throughout most of history and most of the world. Radical
supporters of capitalism describing themselves as anarchists seems to
be a historical anomaly, and they might want to find a name that clashes
less with already existing trains of political thought.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there has been a lot of debate about this perceived
clash of terminology and it seems quite unlikely to change in the
near future.</p>

<h3 id="Animal_Rights"><a class="hanchor" href="#Animal_Rights">"Animal Rights"</a></h3>
<p>From a consequentialist perspective, rights are usually seen as
instrumental heuristics and not as terminal values. When people talk about
animal rights, they usually mean leaving animals alone in the context of
factory farming and opposing interventions in nature. However, <a href="https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/" title="The Importance of W
ild-Animal Suffering">Tomasik
2017</a>
makes a striking case for intervening in nature due to the prevalence of
extreme suffering, usually including highly invasive measures which would
violate a naive concept of "animals rights". However, these interventions
would be designed to increase total animal welfare.</p>

<p>Most feminists today claim that the patriarchy hurts both men <em>and</em>

using it to describe kitsch, skill or practice. I personally would prefer
it if people stopped using the word "art" to describe banal and common
things. "Pick-Up Artistry" falls into this category. It is a skill that
requires sometimes years of practice, but it is a fundamentally practical
and goal-oriented activity, unlike most (if not all) art.</p>

<h3 id="Sentience"><a class="hanchor" href="#Sentience">"Sentience"</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the philosophy of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness">consciousness</a>,
sentience can refer to the ability of any entity to have subjective
perceptual experiences, or as some philosophers refer to them,
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia">qualia</a>". […]
In the philosophies of animal welfare and rights, sentience implies the
ability to experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure">pleasure</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering">pain</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>— English Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience">“Sentience”</a>, 2019</em></p>
<p>Very often, the word "sentience" is used to refer to the ability to
feel pleasure or pain, or, to be more general, have experiences with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology">valence</a>). However,
the strict philosophical definition of "sentience" does not necessarily
entail the ability to feel pleasure or pain, just that some qualia
can be experienced. Although it is very often assumed that sentience
necessarily entails pleasure and pain, it might still be worthwhile
making a distinction between the two.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sentients" is usually defined as beings that are capable of
subjectively perceiving or feeling by means of the senses. This includes
not only beings capable of the feeling of being happy and/or unhappy,
but also includes beings just capable of perceiving things without having
any affective feeling. In principle, it is possible for some sentients
to be capable of perceiving the external world but without feeling
happy or unhappy. One could have sensations of perceiving different
colours without enjoying or disliking seeing them; one could have the
sensation of being touched or even being squeezed without feeling pain or
pleasure. Such non-affective sentients really do not have any positive
or negative welfare. Their welfare is necessarily zero, just like non-
sentients. Hence, for the purpose here, the important dividing line is
not between sentients and non-sentients, but between affective sentients
and non-affective beings (sentient or non-sentient).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>— Yew-Kwang Ng, <a href="./doc/biology/welfare/towards_welfare_biology_evolutionary_economics_of_animal_consciousness_and_suffering_ng_1995.pdf">“Towards Welfare Biology: Evolutionary Economics of Animal Consciousness and Suffering”</a> p. 4, 1995</em></p>
<p>Thus, it seems desirable to differentiate between the ability to have
subjective experiences ("sentience") and the ability to have affective
subjective experiences.</p>

<li>Compared girls with
<ul>
<li>Paintings of aristocracy</li>
<li>Characters in fiction
<ul>
<li>Books I was reading at that time
<ul>
<li>Evelyn Nisbett from “Ragtime” by Doctorow</li>
<li>Baroness vom Zumpe from “2666” by Bolaño</li>
<li>An unnamed girl from the collections of vignettes “Betrachtung” by Kafka</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Movies
<ul>
<li>Trinity from the Matrix (good for girls all dressed in black)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Their hair
<ul>
<li>to a tree trunk</li>
<li>to a candleflame</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Their outfit
<ul>
<li>to abstract modern art</li>
<li>to medieval wallpaper</li>
<li>to something people would wear in 19th century Russia</li>
<li>to the Mediterranian sea</li>
<li>to camel fur that they had gathered at the zoo</li>
<li>to obsidian and volcanic ash</li>
<li>a chimney</li>
<li>a mushroom</li>
<li>a colorful bird</li>
<li>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa">mesa</a></li>
<li>a native American hunting</li>
<li>a black candle</li>
<li>a bear cub/a teddybear</li>
<li>a piano
<ul>
<li>Comparing girls with musical instruments sounds like a pretty good opener in general (viola, violin, saxophone, definitely stirs the imagination)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pointed out contradictions in their style
<ul>
<li>Telling one girl that she looked like she was going to a cocktail party on a mountain</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Openly insulted their clothes
<ul>
<li>Told a girl her shoes looked old, asking her whether she was on the way to buy new ones on a nearby market
<ul>
<li>I am not sure, but I think this one was actually harmful</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I have been told that I'm creative, but I have never observed any
correlation with how well the approach goes and the opener, except for
very boring openers and insults.</p>
