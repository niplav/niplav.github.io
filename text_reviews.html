<h2>The Human Predicament (David Benatar, 2017)</h2>

<p>“The Human Predicament” is a book about life philosophy, written
by the pessimistic analytic philosopher David Benatar. In it, Benatar
describes what he calls the human predicament (hence the title), which
consists in the fact that human lives are usually bad, and much worse
than people themselves think. In his view, human lives lack cosmic (and
sometimes terrestrial) meaning, are bad because they're much shorter
than they could be, much more filled with pain and discomfort than
humans think, and full of ignorance, unfulfilled desires and physical
deterioration during the course of one's lifetime.</p>

<p>However, all alternatives are also bad: death, because it often deprives
of life, and annihilates the person dying; and suicide, for much the
same reasons, unless it annihilates a life that is awful enough to
justify death.</p>

<p>The only positive option is to not come into existence at all–or at
least not make others come into existence, even though one desires to.
He alludes several times to one of his other books, Better Never To Have
Been, in which he advocates for antinatalism.</p>

<p>Reading this book felt a little bit pointless to me. Since beliefs
are for action<!--TODO: gwern link-->, and Benatar is just applying a
linear transformation to all available options (if everything's bad,
nothing is), I didn't gain anything tangible from this text. I had a
phase where I believed antinatalism quite strongly, and still don't
plan on having kids (although I know that this attitude might change
with increasing age), but overall antinatalism does not strike me as
a pragmatic policy<!--cf. David Pearce &amp; Brian Tomasik ("Strategic
Considerations for Ethical Anti-natalists")-->, me instead adopting an
anti-pure-replicator<!--TODO: link to Emilsson--> strategy.</p>

<p>Especially the chapter on meaning felt irrelevant: I don't have an
internal experience of meaning (or the lack thereof), and oscillate
between believing it to be a subtype of high-valence qualia and believing
it to be a mechanism for the mind to do things that are in themselves
not enjoyable (a "second reward signal" next to pleasure).</p>

<p>Benatar mentions cryonics, life extension technology and
transhumanism in general, and while his treatment of these topics
is more respectful than most, he dismisses them very quickly. I
disagree on these points, given that it seems that humanity
can expect to find itself in a period of <a href="https://sideways-view.com/2017/10/04/hyperbolic-growth/" title="Hyperbolic growth">hyperbolic economic
growth</a>
(see <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory" title="Modeling the Human Trajectory">Roodman
2020</a>).</p>

<p>I am also not a fan of the pessimism-optimism distinction. Benatar himself
touches on this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>that a view is pessimistic should, in itself, neither
  count in its favor nor against it. (The same, of course, is true
  of an optimistic view.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>– David Benatar<!--TODO: link-->, “The Human Predicament” p. 225, 2017</em></p>

<p>It seems to me that humans can believe very bad things and still be
happier than most in their lives (I know this is at least true for one
human, myself). This, combined with the fact that Benatar simply shifts
the utility function downwards, makes me prone to rejecting his worldview
as simply a matter of emotional tone on the same facts.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to accuse Benatar of insufficient pessimism (on his own
criteria): The most likely outcome for humanity (and for life in general)
seems not to be total extinction, but instead a universe filled with
beings most capable of copying themselves, the whole cosmos teeming with
subsistence-level beings with very boring conscious experiences<!--TODO:
hanson paper about frontiers &amp; SSC post about substrate type stuff-->
until the stars go out. (Or even worse scenarios from anti-aligned
artificial intelligences).</p>

<p>Overall, the book had some interesting points about suicide, the quality of
life and meaning, but felt rather pointless.</p>

<p><strong>3/10</strong></p>
