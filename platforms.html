this by setting up multiple markets, in order to run two experiments

<h1 id="Using_Prediction_Platforms_to_Select_Quantified_Self_Experiments"><a class="hanchor" href="#Using_Prediction_Platforms_to_Select_Quantified_Self_Experiments">Using Prediction Platforms to Select Quantified Self Experiments</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/prediction-market-causation/#7">dynomight 2022</a>
has a cool proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a good (and well-known) alternative, which is
to randomize decisions sometimes, at random. You tell people: “I will
roll a 20-sided die. If it comes up 1-19, everyone gets their money back
and I do what I want. If it comes up 20, the bets activate and I decide
what to do using a coinflip.”</p>
<p>What’s nice about this is that you can do whatever you want when 1-19
come up, including making your decisions using the market prices. But you
must make decisions randomly sometimes, because if bets never activate,
no one will waste their time betting in your market.</p>
<p>This is elegant. Oh, and by the way are you THE NSF or DARPA or THE
NIH or A BILLIONAIRE WHO WANTS TO SPEND LOTS OF MONEY AND BRAG ABOUT
HOW YOU ADVANCED THE STATE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE MORE THAN ALL THOSE OTHER
LAME BILLIONAIRES WHO WOULDN’T KNOW A HIGH ROI IF IT HIT THEM IN THE
FACE? Well how about this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather proposals for a hundred RCTs that would each be really expensive but also really awesome. (E.g. you could investigate <code>SALT → MORTALITY</code> or <code>ALCOHOL → MORTALITY</code> or <code>UBI → HUMAN FLOURISHING</code>.)</li>
<li>Fund highly liquid markets to predict the outcome of each of these RCTs, conditional on them being funded.
<ul>
<li>If you have hangups about prison, you might want to chat with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">CFTC</a> before doing this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Randomly pick 5% of the proposed projects, fund them as written, and pay off the investors who correctly predicted what would happen.</li>
<li>Take the other 95% of the proposed projects, give the investors their money back, and use the SWEET PREDICTIVE KNOWLEDGE to pick another 10% of the RCTs to fund for STAGGERING SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS and MAXIMAL STATUS ENHANCEMENT.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I'm neither a billionaire nor the NSF or DARPA, but I
<strong>have</strong> run <a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_B_SelfBlinded_RCT">two</a>
<a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_A_SelfBlinded_RCT">shitty</a> self-blinded
RCTs on myself already, and I'm certainly not afraid of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">CFTC</a>.
And indeed I don't have a shortage of ideas on things I
<a href="./todo.html#Quantified_Self">could</a> run RCTs on, but the time is scarce
(I try to collect m=50 samples in each RCT, which (with buffer-days off)
is usually more than 2 months of data collection).</p>
<p>So I'll do what <a href="https://nitter.net/saulmunn/">@saulmunn</a> pointed <a href="https://nitter.net/saulmunn/status/1671923161695240192">out
to me</a>
is a possibility: I'm going to do <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZXy8kGkNFyqCfHEJ/you-can-do-futarchy-yourself">futarchy (on)
myself</a>
by setting up a set of markets of Manifold Markets with respect to the
outcomes of some pre-specified self-blinded RCTs, waiting until the prices
on them equilibriate, and then running two of those RCTs (the "best" one,
by my standards, and a random one) and using the results as resolutions,
while resolving the others as ambiguous.</p>
<h3 id="Timeline"><a class="hanchor" href="#Timeline">Timeline</a></h3>
<p>If the markets receive enough liquidity, I'll start the first experiment
early in 2024, and the second one sometime in 2024 (depending on the
exact experiment), hopefully finishing both before 2025.</p>
<h2 id="Markets"><a class="hanchor" href="#Markets">Markets</a></h2>
<p>Some experiments can be self-blinded, especially ones that involve
substances, others can not because they require me to engage in an
activity or receive some sensory input, so I distinguish the two, and
will slightly prioritise the experiments that can be blinded.</p>
<p>In all experiments, I will be using the statistical method
detailed <a href="./nootropics.html#Statistical_Method">here</a>, code for it
<a href="./code/experiments/load.py">here</a>, unless someone points out that I'm
doing my statistics wrong.</p>
<p>I will be scoring the markets based on the variables specified in the
prediction market title, but I'll of course be collecting <a href="./data.html">a lot of
other data</a> during that time that will also be analyzed.</p>
<h3 id="SelfBlinded_Experiments"><a class="hanchor" href="#SelfBlinded_Experiments">Self-Blinded Experiments</a></h3>
<p>In general, by <em>meditative absorption</em> I mean
the concentration/tranquility (in Buddhist terms
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samatha-vipassana">samatha</a>) during
a ≥30 minute meditation session in the morning, ~45 minutes
after waking up and taking the substance (less if the substance
starts working immediately). I will be doing at least 15 minutes of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapanasati">anapanasati</a> during that
meditation session, but might start (or end) with another practice).</p>

<h4 id="Further_Ideas"><a class="hanchor" href="#Further_Ideas">Further Ideas</a></h4>
<p>I have a couple more ideas on possible experiments that I could run,
and will put them up as I acquire more mana.</p>
<p>Blindeable:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Semaglutide</strong> vs. <strong>Sugar</strong> → <em>Productivity</em> (tracking conscientiousness)</li>
</ol>
<p>Not blindeable:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Binaural Beats</strong> vs. <strong>Silence</strong> → <em>Meditative Absorption</em></li>
<li><strong>Brown Noise</strong> vs. <strong>Silence</strong> → <em>Meditative Absorption</em></li>
<li><strong>Brown Noise</strong> vs. <strong>Music</strong> → <em>Productivity</em></li>
<li><strong>Silence</strong> vs. <strong>Music</strong> → <em>Productivity</em></li>
<li><strong>Time Since Last Masturbation</strong> → <em>Productivity</em></li>
<li><strong>Starting Work Standing</strong> vs. <strong>Starting Work Sitting</strong> → <em>Productivity</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Pleas"><a class="hanchor" href="#Pleas">Pleas</a></h2>
<p>This little exercise may need <strong>your</strong> participation! I have three pleas
to you, dear reader:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Please predict on the markets!</strong> If people predict on the markets, I <em>both</em> get more information about the value of the different experiments, and I also get mana back. It would be cool to know whether hobbyist prediction markets <em>can</em> be used for choosing experiments, and the worst result would be a "well, we can't really tell because liquidity on the markets was too small".</li>
<li><strong>Maybe send me mana for me to create more markets or subsidise existing ones.</strong> I'd love to subsidise my markets on Manifold a whole bunch, but don't have enough mana for that at the moment. <a href="https://manifold.markets/anonymous">clippy</a> and <a href="https://manifold.markets/Tetraspace">Tetraspace</a> both already send me mana, which I greatly appreciate. With more mana, I could also put up more markets, and thereby explore a larger space of possible experiments. However, maybe the value of another market isn't so high, so this one is way less urgent.</li>
<li><strong>Give me ideas for more experiments to run.</strong> If you have an idea you're enthusiastic about and which you've always wanted to have tested, but you're kind of lazy about actually doing it, I might be able to jump in. Most interesting to me are experiments that are:
<ol>
<li><em>Affordable</em>: Expensive substances, high-end devices etc. are too prohibitive (unless you want to buy the thing for me to perform the experiment).</li>
<li><em>Safe</em>: Sorry, I'm not going to take methamphetamine, even though it might make me much more productive.</li>
<li><em>Measurable</em>: The variable the intervention is supposed to affect should be measurable in at least <em>one</em> of the ways <a href="http://niplav.site/data.html">I currently collect data</a>, or at least easily measurable. In particular cognitive performance is hard to get a grip on: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iq_test">IQ test</a> can't be repeated very often, but maybe there's a game that measures cognitive performance reliably?</li>
<li><em>Fast</em>: I can't do 50 samples of an intervention where one sample takes 2 weeks to take effect. Daily is best, but for <em>really good</em> options I might be willing to tolerate 2 samples a week.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that, I also welcome all critiques at any level of detail of
this undertaking.</p>
<h2 id="Further_Ideas_1"><a class="hanchor" href="#Further_Ideas_1">Further Ideas</a></h2>
<p>If I could create more markets, I might be able to put up markets on
different variables I measure during the day. That way, I could select
interventions that dominate others across multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>If there were prediction platforms that supported them,
combinatorial prediction markets or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ufW5LvcwDuL6qjdBT/latent-variables-for-prediction-markets-motivation-technical">latent-variable prediction
markets</a>
could be incredibly cool, but we don't live in that world (yet).</p>
