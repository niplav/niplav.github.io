<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/prediction-market-causation/#7">dynomight 2022</a>
has a cool proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and by the way are you THE NSF or DARPA or THE NIH or A BILLIONAIRE
WHO WANTS TO SPEND LOTS OF MONEY AND BRAG ABOUT HOW YOU ADVANCED THE
STATE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE MORE THAN ALL THOSE OTHER LAME BILLIONAIRES
WHO WOULDN’T KNOW A HIGH ROI IF IT HIT THEM IN THE FACE? Well how
about this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather proposals for a hundred RCTs that would each be really expensive but also really awesome. (E.g. you could investigate <code>SALT → MORTALITY</code> or <code>ALCOHOL → MORTALITY</code> or <code>UBI → HUMAN FLOURISHING</code>.)</li>
<li>Fund highly liquid markets to predict the outcome of each of these RCTs, conditional on them being funded.
<ul>
<li>If you have hangups about prison, you might want to chat with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">CFTC</a> before doing this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Randomly pick 5% of the proposed projects, fund them as written, and pay off the investors who correctly predicted what would happen.</li>
<li>Take the other 95% of the proposed projects, give the investors their money back, and use the SWEET PREDICTIVE KNOWLEDGE to pick another 10% of the RCTs to fund for STAGGERING SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS and MAXIMAL STATUS ENHANCEMENT.</li>
</ol>

<p>Well, I'm neither a billionaire nor the NSF or DARPA, but I
<strong>have</strong> run <a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_B_SelfBlinded_RCT">two</a>
<a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_A_SelfBlinded_RCT">shitty</a> self-blinded
RCTs on myself already, and I'm certainly not afraid of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">CFTC</a>.
And indeed I don't have a shortage of ideas on things I
<a href="./todo.html#Quantified_Self">could</a> run RCTs on, but the time is scarce
(I try to collect m=50 samples in each RCT, which (with buffer-days off)
is usually more than 2 months of data collection).</p>
<p>So I'll do what <a href="https://nitter.net/saulmunn/">@saulmunn</a> pointed <a href="https://nitter.net/saulmunn/status/1671923161695240192">out
to me</a>
is a possibility: I'm going to do <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZXy8kGkNFyqCfHEJ/you-can-do-futarchy-yourself">futarchy (on)
myself</a>
by setting up a set of markets of Manifold Markets with respect to the
outcomes of some pre-specified self-blinded RCTs, waiting until the prices
on them equilibriate, and then running two of those RCTs (the "best" one,
by my standards, and a random one) and using the results as resolutions,
while resolving the others as ambiguous.</p>
<h3 id="Timeline"><a class="hanchor" href="#Timeline">Timeline</a></h3>
<p>If the markets receive enough liquidity, I'll start the first experiment
early in 2024, and the second one sometime in 2024 (depending on the
exact experiment), hopefully finishing both before 2025.</p>
<h2 id="Markets"><a class="hanchor" href="#Markets">Markets</a></h2>
<p>Some experiments can be self-blinded, especially ones that involve
substances, others can not because they require me to engage in an
activity or receive some sensory input, so I distinguish the two, and
will slightly prioritise the experiments that can be blinded.</p>
<p>In all experiments, I will be using the statistical method
detailed <a href="./nootropics.html#Statistical_Method">here</a>, code for it
<a href="./code/experiments/load.py">here</a>, unless someone points out that I'm
doing my statistics wrong.</p>
<p>I will be scoring the markets based on the variables specified in the
prediction market title, but I'll of course be collecting <a href="./data.html">a lot of
other data</a> during that time that will also be analyzed.</p>

<h2 id="Pleas"><a class="hanchor" href="#Pleas">Pleas</a></h2>
<p>This little exercise may need <strong>your</strong> participation! I have three pleas
to you, dear reader:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Please predict on the markets!</strong> If people predict on the markets, I <em>both</em> get more information about the value of the different experiments, and I also get mana back. It would be cool to know whether hobbyist prediction markets <em>can</em> be used for choosing experiments, and the worst result would be a "well, we can't really tell because liquidity on the markets was too small".</li>
<li><strong>Maybe send me mana for me to create more markets or subsidise existing ones.</strong> I'd love to subsidise my markets on Manifold a whole bunch, but don't have enough mana for that at the moment. <a href="https://manifold.markets/anonymous">clippy</a> and <a href="https://manifold.markets/Tetraspace">Tetraspace</a> both already send me mana, which I greatly appreciate. With more mana, I could also put up more markets, and thereby explore a larger space of possible experiments. However, maybe the value of another market isn't so high, so this one is way less urgent.<!--TODO: acknowledge other mana gifters--></li>
<li><strong>Give me ideas for more experiments to run.</strong> If you have an idea you're enthusiastic about and which you've always wanted to have tested, but you're kind of lazy about actually doing it, I might be able to jump in. Most interesting to me are experiments that are:
<ol>
<li><em>Affordable</em>: Expensive substances, high-end devices etc. are too prohibitive (unless you want to buy the thing for me to perform the experiment).</li>
<li><em>Safe</em>: Sorry, I'm not going to take methamphetamine, even though it might make me much more productive.</li>
<li><em>Measurable</em>: The variable the intervention is supposed to affect should be measurable in at least <em>one</em> of the ways <a href="http://niplav.site/data.html">I currently collect data</a>, or at least easily measurable. In particular cognitive performance is hard to get a grip on: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iq_test">IQ test</a> can't be repeated very often, but maybe there's a game that measures cognitive performance reliably, or could I use <a href="https://gwern.net/dnb-faq">dual n-back</a>?</li>
<li><em>Fast</em>: I can't do 50 samples of an intervention where one sample takes 2 weeks to take effect. Daily is best, but for <em>really good</em> options I might be willing to tolerate 2 samples a week.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that, I also welcome all critiques at any level of detail of
this undertaking.</p>
<h2 id="Further_Ideas_1"><a class="hanchor" href="#Further_Ideas_1">Further Ideas</a></h2>
<p>If I could create more markets, I might be able to put up markets on
different variables I measure during the day. That way, I could select
interventions that dominate others across multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>If there were prediction platforms that supported them,
combinatorial prediction markets or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ufW5LvcwDuL6qjdBT/latent-variables-for-prediction-markets-motivation-technical">latent-variable prediction

<p>Over time, I'll put some explanations on why these specific experiments
interest me. Not yet fully, though.</p>
<h3 id="None"><a class="hanchor" href="#None">L-Theanine + Caffeine vs. Sugar → <em>Meditative Absorption</em></a></h3>
<p>My <a href="./nootropics.html#LTheanine">l-theanine experiment</a> gave disappointing
results, but people have (rightfully) pointed out<!--TODO: where?-->
that l-theanine is best taken together with caffeine: one gets energy
<em>and</em> relaxation at the same time.</p>
<p>This points at a broader possibility: Why not set up
markets for all possible combinations of nootropics? But
alas, this runs into problems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion">combinatorial
explosion</a>.</p>

<h3 id="None_6"><a class="hanchor" href="#None_6">CBD Oil vs. Similar-Tasting Oil → <em>Meditative Absorption</em> and THC Oil vs. Similar-Tasting Oil → <em>Meditative Absorption</em></a></h3>
<p>My brother, in conversation, brought up that smoking weed is incredibly
relaxing to him, and told me he imagines that this is what he thinks
deep meditative states feel like. That intrigues me enough to consider
it as intervention towards absorption, if not mindfulness (albeit one
that has the danger of creating subtly dull states of mind).</p>

<h3 id="None_10"><a class="hanchor" href="#None_10">Pomodoro Method vs. Nothing → <em>Productivity</em></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pomodoro technique also uses the concept of rhythm, breaking up
the day into twenty-five-minute segments of work and five minutes of
a break. Interestingly, though, I found no academic study that tested
the technique.</p>
