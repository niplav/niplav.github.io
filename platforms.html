<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/prediction-market-causation/#7">dynomight 2022</a>
has a very cool proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and by the way are you THE NSF or DARPA or THE NIH or A BILLIONAIRE
WHO WANTS TO SPEND LOTS OF MONEY AND BRAG ABOUT HOW YOU ADVANCED THE
STATE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE MORE THAN ALL THOSE OTHER LAME BILLIONAIRES
WHO WOULDN’T KNOW A HIGH ROI IF IT HIT THEM IN THE FACE? Well how
about this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather proposals for a hundred RCTs that would each be really expensive but also really awesome. (E.g. you could investigate <code>SALT → MORTALITY</code> or <code>ALCOHOL → MORTALITY</code> or <code>UBI → HUMAN FLOURISHING</code>.)</li>
<li>Fund highly liquid markets to predict the outcome of each of these RCTs, conditional on them being funded.
<ul>
<li>If you have hangups about prison, you might want to chat with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">CFTC</a> before doing this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Randomly pick 5% of the proposed projects, fund them as written, and pay off the investors who correctly predicted what would happen.</li>
<li>Take the other 95% of the proposed projects, give the investors their money back, and use the SWEET PREDICTIVE KNOWLEDGE to pick another 10% of the RCTs to fund for STAGGERING SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS and MAXIMAL STATUS ENHANCEMENT.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em>—<a href="https://dynomight.net/prediction-market-causation/">dynomight</a>, <a href="https://dynomight.net/prediction-market-causation/">“Prediction market does not imply causation”</a>, 2022</em></p>
<p>Well, I'm neither a billionaire nor the NSF or DARPA, but I
<em>have</em> run <a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_B_SelfBlinded_RCT">two</a>
<a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_A_SelfBlinded_RCT">shitty</a> self-blinded
RCTs on myself already, and I'm certainly not afraid of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">CFTC</a>.
And indeed I don't have a shortage of ideas on things I
<a href="./todo.html#Quantified_Self">could</a> run RCTs on, but the time is scarce
(I try to collect m=50 samples in each RCT, which (with buffer-days off)
is usually more than 2 months of data collection).</p>
<p>So I'll do what <a href="http://nitter.poast.org/saulmunn/">@saulmunn</a> pointed <a href="http://nitter.poast.org/saulmunn/status/1671923161695240192">out
to me</a>
is a possibility: I'm going to do <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZXy8kGkNFyqCfHEJ/you-can-do-futarchy-yourself">futarchy (on)
myself</a>
by setting up a set of markets of Manifold Markets with respect to the
outcomes of some pre-specified self-blinded RCTs, waiting until the prices
on them equilibriate, and then running two of those RCTs (the "best" one,
by my standards, and a random one) and using the results as resolutions,
while resolving the others as ambiguous.</p>
<h3 id="Timeline"><a class="hanchor" href="#Timeline">Timeline</a></h3>
<p>If the markets receive enough liquidity, I'll start the first experiment
early in 2024, and the second one sometime in 2024 (depending on the
exact experiment), hopefully finishing both before 2025.</p>
<h2 id="Markets"><a class="hanchor" href="#Markets">Markets</a></h2>
<p>Some experiments can be self-blinded, especially ones that involve
substances, others can not because they require me to engage in an
activity or receive some sensory input, so I distinguish the two, and
will slightly prioritise the experiments that can be blinded.</p>
<p>In all experiments, I will be using the statistical method
detailed <a href="./nootropics.html#Statistical_Method">here</a>, code for it
<a href="./code/experiments/load.py">here</a>, unless someone points out that I'm
doing my statistics wrong.</p>
<p>I will be scoring the markets based on the variables specified in the
prediction market title, but I'll of course be collecting <a href="./data.html">a lot of
other data</a> during that time that will also be analyzed.</p>

It would be cool to know whether hobbyist prediction markets <em>can</em> be used for choosing experiments, and the worst result would be a "well, we can't really tell because liquidity on the markets was too small".</li>
<li><strong>Maybe send me mana for me to create more markets or subsidise existing ones.</strong> I'd love to subsidise my markets on Manifold a whole bunch, but don't have enough mana for that at the moment. <a href="https://manifold.markets/anonymous">clippy</a> and <a href="https://manifold.markets/Tetraspace">Tetraspace</a> both already send me mana, which I greatly appreciate. With more mana, I could also put up more markets, and thereby explore a larger space of possible experiments. However, maybe the value of another market isn't so high, so this one is way less urgent.<!--TODO: acknowledge other mana gifters--></li>
<li><strong>Give me ideas for more experiments to run.</strong> If you have an idea you're enthusiastic about and which you've always wanted to have tested, but you're kind of lazy about actually doing it, I might be able to jump in. Most interesting to me are experiments that are:
<ol>
<li><em>Affordable</em>: Expensive substances, high-end devices etc. are too prohibitive (unless you want to buy the thing for me to perform the experiment).</li>
<li><em>Safe</em>: Sorry, I'm not going to take methamphetamine, even though it might make me much more productive.</li>
<li><em>Measurable</em>: The variable the intervention is supposed to affect should be measurable in at least <em>one</em> of the ways <a href="./data.html">I currently collect data</a>, or at least easily measurable. In particular cognitive performance is hard to get a grip on: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iq_test">IQ test</a> can't be repeated very often, but maybe there's a game that measures cognitive performance reliably, or could I use <a href="https://gwern.net/dnb-faq">dual n-back</a>?</li>
<li><em>Fast</em>: I can't do 50 samples of an intervention where one sample takes 2 weeks to take effect. Daily is best, but for <em>really good</em> options I might be willing to tolerate 2 samples a week.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that, I also welcome all critiques at any level of detail of
this undertaking.</p>
<h2 id="Further_Ideas_1"><a class="hanchor" href="#Further_Ideas_1">Further Ideas</a></h2>
<p>If I could create more markets, I might be able to put up markets on
different variables I measure during the day. That way, I could select
interventions that dominate others across multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>If there were prediction platforms that supported them,
combinatorial prediction markets or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ufW5LvcwDuL6qjdBT/latent-variables-for-prediction-markets-motivation-technical">latent-variable prediction
markets</a>
could be incredibly cool, but we don't live in that world (yet).</p>
<h2 id="Results"><a class="hanchor" href="#Results">Results</a></h2>
<p>On 2024-01-25, I decided to select the experiment.
<code>seq 1 14 | shuf | tail -1</code> output <code>12</code>, which corresponds
to the experiment <a href="https://manifold.markets/NiplavYushtun/by-how-much-does-the-pomodoro-metho">Pomodoro Method vs. Nothing →
<em>Productivity</em></a>.</p>
<p>The market with the highest expected
effect size is <a href="https://manifold.markets/NiplavYushtun/by-how-much-does-very-bright-light">Bright Light vs. Normal Light →
<em>Happiness</em></a>,
so those are the two experiments I am going to run.</p>
<p>I am a bit weary of selecting these two markets: The Bright Light market
has the lowest trading volume of all markets, at only M̶104, and both
these markets are not blindeable.</p>
<p>But a commitment I have made, so a commitment I have to follow through
with.</p>

<p>I ran the experiment from 2024-01-29 to 2024-06-17,
using <a href="https://github.com/pickfire/spt">spt</a> with <a href="./data/pomscript">this
script</a>, managed by <a href="./data/pomanage">this script</a>.</p>
<p>The data on whether a particular day was a pomodoro-method day was saved
in <a href="./data/ispomodoro.csv">this file</a>, and the data on the pomodoros
was saved in <a href="./data/pomodoros.csv">this file</a>.</p>
<p>The code for loading and transforming the pomodoro data isn't
particularly interesting, if you're curious you can find it in <a href="./code/experiments/load.py">this
file</a>.</p>
<pre><code>datasets=get_datasets_pom()
</code></pre>
<p>Let's proceed to the analysis, then (using the same methodology as for my
<a href=".//nootropics.html#Statistical_Method">nootropics experiments</a>:</p>
<pre><code>res=analyze(datasets)
</code></pre>
<p>And the results are:</p>

<p>I didn't meditate or do flashcards during that time.</p>
<p>So the pomodoro method somewhat increases productivity (at the edge of
statistical significance), and <em>maybe</em> decreases subjective length of
the day a bit. It also decreases horniness a little bit, which I find
pretty funny<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="Vitamin_D"><a class="hanchor" href="#Vitamin_D">Vitamin D₃</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_C_SelfBlinded_RCT">Vitamin D₃

of Vitamin D₃ on absorption (more at the link).</p>
<h3 id="Scoring_the_Market"><a class="hanchor" href="#Scoring_the_Market">Scoring the Market</a></h3>
<p>I can now score the market with the results from the two experiments:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

def logscore(o,p):
        return np.mean(o*np.log(p)+(np.ones_like(o)-o)*np.log(np.ones_like(p)-p))

pomodoro_o=np.array([0, 0, 1, 0, 0])

-0.3258531953347593

vitamin_p=np.array([0.39, 0.41, 0.08, 0.06, 0.05])
vitamin_o=np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0])
logscore(vitamin_o, vitamin_p)
-0.3331583177971012
</code></pre>
<p>Honestly: The markets did pretty well.</p>
<h2 id="0836_Bits_of_Evidence_for_Futarchy"><a class="hanchor" href="#0836_Bits_of_Evidence_for_Futarchy">0.836 Bits of Evidence for Futarchy</a></h2>
<p>So, <a href="./platforms.html#Table_of_Current_Market_Status">I put up some prediction markets on the results of quantified
self RCTs</a>. I <a href="./platforms.html#Pomodoros">ran
two of the experiments</a>, and <a href="./platforms.html#Scoring_the_Market">scored both
markets</a> on the results.</p>
<p>How much should the performance of the market change our opinion about
the viability of using prediction platforms to predict RCTs, and thus be
plausibly useful in selecting experiments to run and actions to perform?</p>
<p>One issue here is that we only observed two datapoints: Two logscores
from the markets on the Pomodoro method (-0.326) and the Vitamin D₃
experiment (-0.333). Qualitatively these are already fairly assuring
because they're both far better than a random score of -0.69. But if we
want to quantify the amount of information we've gained, we can do that
by performing a Bayesian update.</p>
<p>For that, we need a prior. What prior to choose? I
tried fiddling around a bit with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential
distribution</a>,
which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_entropy_distribution">maximum entropy
distribution</a>
over possible logscores, only nailed down by the mean of the
distribution. It represents a state of minimal knowledge.</p>
<p>There's also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-distribution">Gamma
distribution</a>
which is great because it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior">conjugate
prior</a> assuming an
exponentially distributed underlying data generating process. So,
after updating on the datapoints we again get a Gamma-distribution as
the posterior.</p>
<p>But I didn't go with that one because… I wasn't getting the pretty
results I wanted<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>With the exponential distribution, a thing that happened was that I'd
calculate the resulting distribution after two updates, but the first
update would be very aggressive and the second update would then update
away <em>harder</em> than the first update had updated towards the datapoints,
causing a net information <em>loss</em>. The exponential distribution <em>also</em>
has very long tails, resulting in a median of -1.0, which implies that the
median market has a logscore that is <em>worse than chance</em>. I don't believe
that to be the case. (The maxent mean implies that the mean market is
only as good as chance, which I also wouldn't believe a priori? I think?)</p>
<p>As for using the Gamma distribution as a prior, I simply don't think that
the underlying data generating process is exponentially distributed, and
thus we don't get any advantage through conjugacy. The Gamma distribution
also has <em>two</em> parameters, which is too much to be nailed down with only
two datapoints.<!--TODO: find claude conversation, go through examples
& calculations--></p>
<p>So I decided to pick a different prior, and landed on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-normal_distribution">half normal
distribution</a>
with half-normally distributed variance (<code>σ ~ HalfNormal(0.5)</code>), which
has some nicer properties than the exponential distribution, especially
with its thin tails. But the half normal distribution can't be updated
in a closed-form solution, so instead I had to write a short script
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyMC">pymc</a>. Because of missing
conjugacy the resulting distribution is <em>not</em> a half-normal distribution,
but something a lot more complicated. I can't be bothered to try to
calculate what it even is.</p>
<p>Summary visualization of the update:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/platforms/update.png"></p>
<p>The script<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> initializes the model with the
half normal prior, which in turn has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Deviation">standard
deviation</a> distributed
with <code>HalfNormal("sigma", sigma=0.5)</code>. We then update on <code>observed=[0.326,
0.333]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>with pm.Model() as adaptive_model:
    σ = pm.HalfNormal('sigma', sigma=0.5)
    obs = pm.HalfNormal('distances', sigma=σ, observed=distances)
    trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, chains=4, target_accept=0.95,
                      return_inferencedata=True)
</code></pre>
<p>We can then observe the samples for the new standard deviation</p>
<pre><code>σ_samples = trace.posterior.sigma.values.flatten()
σ_mean = np.mean(σ_samples)
</code></pre>
<p>and calculate the log-likelihoods, the Bayes factor, and the number of bits in the update:</p>
<pre><code>results = {}
null_σ = null_sigmas[0]

ll_adaptive = np.sum(stats.halfnorm.logpdf(distances, scale=σ_mean))
ll_null = np.sum(stats.halfnorm.logpdf(distances, scale=null_σ))

log_bf = ll_adaptive - ll_null
bits = log_bf / np.log(2)
bf = np.exp(log_bf)
