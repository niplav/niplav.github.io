<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/prediction-market-causation/#7">dynomight 2022</a>
has a good proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a good (and well-known) alternative, which is
to randomize decisions sometimes, at random. You tell people: “I will
roll a 20-sided die. If it comes up 1-19, everyone gets their money back
and I do what I want. If it comes up 20, the bets activate and I decide
what to do using a coinflip.”</p>
<p>What’s nice about this is that you can do whatever you want when 1-19
come up, including making your decisions using the market prices. But you
must make decisions randomly sometimes, because if bets never activate,
no one will waste their time betting in your market.</p>
<p>This is elegant. Oh, and by the way are you THE NSF or DARPA or THE
NIH or A BILLIONAIRE WHO WANTS TO SPEND LOTS OF MONEY AND BRAG ABOUT
HOW YOU ADVANCED THE STATE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE MORE THAN ALL THOSE OTHER
LAME BILLIONAIRES WHO WOULDN’T KNOW A HIGH ROI IF IT HIT THEM IN THE
FACE? Well how about this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather proposals for a hundred RCTs that would each be really expensive but also really awesome. (E.g. you could investigate <code>SALT → MORTALITY</code> or <code>ALCOHOL → MORTALITY</code> or <code>UBI → HUMAN FLOURISHING</code>.)</li>
<li>Fund highly liquid markets to predict the outcome of each of these RCTs, conditional on them being funded.
<ul>
<li>If you have hangups about prison, you might want to chat with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">CFTC</a> before doing this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Randomly pick 5% of the proposed projects, fund them as written, and pay off the investors who correctly predicted what would happen.</li>
<li>Take the other 95% of the proposed projects, give the investors their money back, and use the SWEET PREDICTIVE KNOWLEDGE to pick another 10% of the RCTs to fund for STAGGERING SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS and MAXIMAL STATUS ENHANCEMENT.</li>
</ol>

<p>Well, I'm neither a billionaire nor the NSF or DARPA, but I <strong>have</strong> run
<a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_A_SelfBlinded_RCT">shitty</a> self-blinded
<a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_B_SelfBlinded_RCT">RCTs</a>
already, and I'm certainly not afraid of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">CFTC</a>.
And indeed I don't have a shortage of ideas on things I
<a href="./todo.html#Quantified_Self">could</a> run RCTs on, but the time is scarce
(I try to collect m=50 samples in each RCT, which (with days off) is
usually more than 2 months of data collection).</p>
<p>So I'll do what <a href="https://twitter.com/saulmunn/">@saulmunn</a> pointed <a href="https://twitter.com/saulmunn/status/1671923161695240192">out
to me</a>
is a possibility: I'm going to do <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZXy8kGkNFyqCfHEJ/you-can-do-futarchy-yourself">futarchy
myself</a>
by setting up a set of markets of Manifold Markets with respect to the
outcomes of some pre-specified self-blinded RCTs, waiting until bets
on them accumulate, and then running two of those RCTs (the "best" one,
by my standards, and a random one) and using the results as resolutions,
while resolving the others as ambiguous.</p>
<h3 id="Timeline"><a class="hanchor" href="#Timeline">Timeline</a></h3>
<p>If the markets receive enough liquidity, I'll start the first experiment
mid November, and the second one early next year, hopefully sometime
in February.</p>
<h2 id="Markets"><a class="hanchor" href="#Markets">Markets</a></h2>
<h2 id="Plea"><a class="hanchor" href="#Plea">Plea</a></h2>
<p>I would love to subsidise my markets on Manifold a whole bunch, but
don't have enough mana for that (I've subsidised them best I could).</p>
<p>So here is my plea: <strong>Please predict on the markets!</strong></p>
<p>It would be cool to know whether hobbyist prediction markets <em>can</em> be
used for choosing experiments, and the worst result would be a "well,
we can't really tell because liquidity on the markets was too small".</p>
