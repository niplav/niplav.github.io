<p><strong>There are too many possible quantified self experiments to run. Do

this by setting up <a href="#Markets">multiple markets</a>, in order to run two

<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/prediction-market-causation/#7">dynomight 2022</a>
has a very cool proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and by the way are you THE NSF or DARPA or THE NIH or A BILLIONAIRE
WHO WANTS TO SPEND LOTS OF MONEY AND BRAG ABOUT HOW YOU ADVANCED THE
STATE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE MORE THAN ALL THOSE OTHER LAME BILLIONAIRES
WHO WOULDN’T KNOW A HIGH ROI IF IT HIT THEM IN THE FACE? Well how
about this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gather proposals for a hundred RCTs that would each be really expensive but also really awesome. (E.g. you could investigate <code>SALT → MORTALITY</code> or <code>ALCOHOL → MORTALITY</code> or <code>UBI → HUMAN FLOURISHING</code>.)</li>
<li>Fund highly liquid markets to predict the outcome of each of these RCTs, conditional on them being funded.
<ul>
<li>If you have hangups about prison, you might want to chat with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">CFTC</a> before doing this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Randomly pick 5% of the proposed projects, fund them as written, and pay off the investors who correctly predicted what would happen.</li>
<li>Take the other 95% of the proposed projects, give the investors their money back, and use the SWEET PREDICTIVE KNOWLEDGE to pick another 10% of the RCTs to fund for STAGGERING SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS and MAXIMAL STATUS ENHANCEMENT.</li>
</ol>

<p>Well, I'm neither a billionaire nor the NSF or DARPA, but I
<em>have</em> run <a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_B_SelfBlinded_RCT">two</a>
<a href="./nootropics.html#Experiment_A_SelfBlinded_RCT">shitty</a> self-blinded
RCTs on myself already, and I'm certainly not afraid of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission">CFTC</a>.
And indeed I don't have a shortage of ideas on things I
<a href="./todo.html#Quantified_Self">could</a> run RCTs on, but the time is scarce
(I try to collect m=50 samples in each RCT, which (with buffer-days off)
is usually more than 2 months of data collection).</p>
<p>So I'll do what <a href="http://nitter.poast.org/saulmunn/">@saulmunn</a> pointed <a href="http://nitter.poast.org/saulmunn/status/1671923161695240192">out
to me</a>
is a possibility: I'm going to do <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZXy8kGkNFyqCfHEJ/you-can-do-futarchy-yourself">futarchy (on)
myself</a>
by setting up a set of markets of Manifold Markets with respect to the
outcomes of some pre-specified self-blinded RCTs, waiting until the prices
on them equilibriate, and then running two of those RCTs (the "best" one,
by my standards, and a random one) and using the results as resolutions,
while resolving the others as ambiguous.</p>
<h3 id="Timeline"><a class="hanchor" href="#Timeline">Timeline</a></h3>
<p>If the markets receive enough liquidity, I'll start the first experiment
early in 2024, and the second one sometime in 2024 (depending on the
exact experiment), hopefully finishing both before 2025.</p>
<h2 id="Markets"><a class="hanchor" href="#Markets">Markets</a></h2>
<p>Some experiments can be self-blinded, especially ones that involve
substances, others can not because they require me to engage in an
activity or receive some sensory input, so I distinguish the two, and
will slightly prioritise the experiments that can be blinded.</p>
<p>In all experiments, I will be using the statistical method
detailed <a href="./nootropics.html#Statistical_Method">here</a>, code for it
<a href="./code/experiments/load.py">here</a>, unless someone points out that I'm
doing my statistics wrong.</p>
<p>I will be scoring the markets based on the variables specified in the
prediction market title, but I'll of course be collecting <a href="./data.html">a lot of
other data</a> during that time that will also be analyzed.</p>

<h2 id="Pleas"><a class="hanchor" href="#Pleas">Pleas</a></h2>
<p>This little exercise may need <strong>your</strong> participation! I have three pleas
to you, dear reader:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Please predict on the markets!</strong> If people predict on the markets, I <em>both</em> get more information about the value of the different experiments, and I also get mana back. It would be cool to know whether hobbyist prediction markets <em>can</em> be used for choosing experiments, and the worst result would be a "well, we can't really tell because liquidity on the markets was too small".</li>
<li><strong>Maybe send me mana for me to create more markets or subsidise existing ones.</strong> I'd love to subsidise my markets on Manifold a whole bunch, but don't have enough mana for that at the moment. <a href="https://manifold.markets/anonymous">clippy</a> and <a href="https://manifold.markets/Tetraspace">Tetraspace</a> both already send me mana, which I greatly appreciate. With more mana, I could also put up more markets, and thereby explore a larger space of possible experiments. However, maybe the value of another market isn't so high, so this one is way less urgent.<!--TODO: acknowledge other mana gifters--></li>
<li><strong>Give me ideas for more experiments to run.</strong> If you have an idea you're enthusiastic about and which you've always wanted to have tested, but you're kind of lazy about actually doing it, I might be able to jump in. Most interesting to me are experiments that are:
<ol>
<li><em>Affordable</em>: Expensive substances, high-end devices etc. are too prohibitive (unless you want to buy the thing for me to perform the experiment).</li>
<li><em>Safe</em>: Sorry, I'm not going to take methamphetamine, even though it might make me much more productive.</li>
<li><em>Measurable</em>: The variable the intervention is supposed to affect should be measurable in at least <em>one</em> of the ways <a href="./data.html">I currently collect data</a>, or at least easily measurable. In particular cognitive performance is hard to get a grip on: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iq_test">IQ test</a> can't be repeated very often, but maybe there's a game that measures cognitive performance reliably, or could I use <a href="https://gwern.net/dnb-faq">dual n-back</a>?</li>
<li><em>Fast</em>: I can't do 50 samples of an intervention where one sample takes 2 weeks to take effect. Daily is best, but for <em>really good</em> options I might be willing to tolerate 2 samples a week.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that, I also welcome all critiques at any level of detail of
this undertaking.</p>
<h2 id="Further_Ideas_1"><a class="hanchor" href="#Further_Ideas_1">Further Ideas</a></h2>
<p>If I could create more markets, I might be able to put up markets on
different variables I measure during the day. That way, I could select
interventions that dominate others across multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>If there were prediction platforms that supported them,
combinatorial prediction markets or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ufW5LvcwDuL6qjdBT/latent-variables-for-prediction-markets-motivation-technical">latent-variable prediction
markets</a>
could be incredibly cool, but we don't live in that world (yet).</p>
<h2 id="Results"><a class="hanchor" href="#Results">Results</a></h2>
<p>On 2024-01-25, I decided to select the experiment.
<code>seq 1 14 | shuf | tail -1</code> output <code>12</code>, which corresponds
to the experiment <a href="https://manifold.markets/NiplavYushtun/by-how-much-does-the-pomodoro-metho">Pomodoro Method vs. Nothing →
<em>Productivity</em></a>.</p>
<p>The market with the highest expected
effect size is <a href="https://manifold.markets/NiplavYushtun/by-how-much-does-very-bright-light">Bright Light vs. Normal Light →
<em>Happiness</em></a>,
so those are the two experiments I am going to run.</p>
<p>I am a bit weary of selecting these two markets: The Bright Light market
has the lowest trading volume of all markets, at only M̶104, and both
these markets are not blindeable.</p>
<p>But a commitment I have made, so a commitment I have to follow through
with.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="./img/platforms/pomodoro_results.png"/></p>
<p>I ran the experiment from 2024-01-29 to 2024-06-17,
using <a href="https://github.com/pickfire/spt">spt</a> with <a href="./data/pomscript">this
script</a>, managed by <a href="./data/pomanage">this script</a>.</p>
<p>The data on whether a particular day was a pomodoro-method day was saved
in <a href="./data/ispomodoro.csv">this file</a>, and the data on the pomodoros
was saved in <a href="./data/pomodoros.csv">this file</a>.</p>
<p>The code for loading and transforming the pomodoro data isn't
particularly interesting, if you're curious you can find it in <a href="./code/experiments/load.py">this
file</a>.</p>
<pre><code>datasets=get_datasets_pom()
</code></pre>
<p>Let's proceed to the analysis, then (using the same methodology as for my
<a href=".//nootropics.html#Statistical_Method">nootropics experiments</a>:</p>
<pre><code>res=analyze(datasets)
</code></pre>
<p>And the results are:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; res

</code></pre>
<p>I didn't meditate or do flashcards during that time.</p>
<p>So the pomodoro method somewhat increases productivity (at the edge of
statistical significance), and <em>maybe</em> decreases subjective length of
the day a bit. It also decreases horniness a little bit, which I find
pretty funny<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="Scoring_the_Market"><a class="hanchor" href="#Scoring_the_Market">Scoring the Market</a></h3>
<p>I can now score the market:</p>
<pre><code>def logscore(o,p):
        return np.mean(o*np.log(p)+(np.ones_like(o)-o)*np.log(np.ones_like(p)-p))
p=np.array([0.06, 0.29, 0.39, 0.19, 0.07])
o=np.array([0, 0, 1, 0, 0])
logscore(outcomes, p)
-0.3258531953347593
</code></pre>
<p>Honestly: The market did pretty well.</p>
<h2 id="0202_Bits_of_Evidence_For_Futarchy"><a class="hanchor" href="#0202_Bits_of_Evidence_For_Futarchy">0.202 Bits of Evidence For Futarchy</a></h2>
<p>So, <a href="./platforms.html#Table_of_Current_Market_Status">I put up some prediction markets on the results of quantified
self RCTs</a>. I <a href="./platforms.html#Pomodoros">ran
one of the experiments</a>, and <a href="./platforms.html#Scoring_the_Market">scored one
market</a> on the results.</p>
<p>How much should the performance of the market change our opinion about
the viability of using prediction platforms to predict RCTs, and thus be
plausibly useful in selecting experiments to run and actions to perform?</p>
<p>We can define the maximum entropy distribution
(our prior on how good <a href="https://dynomight.net/prediction-market-causation/">causal Futarchy markets should
be</a>) over possible
log scores as having the mean of the log score of random forecasts,
namely -0.6931…</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_entropy_distribution">maximum entropy
distribution</a>
for a given mean on the positive
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Numbers">reals</a> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential
distribution</a>.</p>
<p>The exponential distribution is defined by one parameter, which is
<code>$\lambda=\frac{1}{μ}$</code> (the mean of the distribution), in this case
<code>$\lambda=\frac{1}{0.6931} \approx 1.4427$</code> (for convenience flipping
the distribution to be defined over positive reals). The logscore
observed for the Pomodoro method market was 0.3258, so the posterior
distribution is <code>$\text{Exponential}(λ + 1/x)$</code>: <code>$λ_{n} = 1.4427 +
1/0.326 ≈ 4.5102$</code>.</p>
<p>To calculate the bits of evidence we got from
running the market, we calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain">information
gain</a>, the bits of
evidence are calculated by log₂(posterior odds / prior odds).</p>
<p>For continuous distributions, we use probability densities, for the
exponential distribution:</p>
<div>
    $$\log_2 \frac{(4.5102 \cdot \exp(-4.5102 \cdot 0.326))}{(1.4427 \cdot \exp(-1.4427 \cdot 0.326))} ≈ \\
    \log_2(1.0367 / 0.9014) ≈ \\
    0.20176$$
</div>
<p>I don't really have a comparison point which to compare this result to,
but ≈0.2 bits of evidence seems fairly small to me. I guess I'll have
to run some more experiments for further evidence.</p>

<p>My <a href="./nootropics.html#LTheanine">l-theanine experiment</a> gave disappointing
results, but people have (rightfully) pointed out<!--TODO: where?-->
that l-theanine is best taken together with caffeine: one gets energy
<em>and</em> relaxation at the same time.</p>
<p>This points at a broader possibility: Why not set up
markets for all possible combinations of nootropics? But

it as intervention towards absorption, if not mindfulness (albeit one

a break. Interestingly, though, I found no academic study that tested
