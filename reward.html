<p>Recently, the Ideas Project
<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xapRLBTpMYokrpd9q">announced</a>
a <a href="https://effectiveideas.org/">$500,000 prize</a> for
new blogs.</p>
<p>The prize will award an up to $100,000 prize each to the five best recent
blogs, in order to encourage the discussions around effective altruism
and related topics. Blogs need to be public, generally concerned with
effective altruism and longtermism, and should have been started within
the last 12 months.</p>
<p>I believe that this prize is flawed in some subtle and not-so-subtle
ways, which I first lay out, and then propose some alternative prizes
which solve some of the underlying issues.</p>
<h2 id="Critique"><a class="hanchor" href="#Critique">Critique</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Blog posts’ might be the answer. But I have read
blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph
of the hare over the tortoise. They are meant to be read
by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and
are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/fashion/07blogs.html">quickly</a>
⁠<a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/technology/2009-arnold-bloggingstatisticsanddemographics.html">abandoned</a>—and
perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that
sad? Isn’t it a terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand,
the best blogs always seem to be building something: they are rough
drafts—works in progress<a href="https://www.gwern.net/About#fn15">¹⁵</a>. So
I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen
content”, what would constitute Long Content as opposed to the
existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now sort
of way?<a href="https://www.gwern.net/About#fn16">¹⁶</a></p>

<h3 id="Blogs_Are_Short_Content"><a class="hanchor" href="#Blogs_Are_Short_Content">Blogs Are Short Content</a></h3>
<p>Except for rare exceptions (<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com">Slate Star Codex</a>
being the most notable one), blogs usually don’t provide much
long-term value—who cares enough to read the whole archive of a
blog, unless the author is exceptionally skilled? Even in the case
of Scott Alexander, additional effort had to be made to <a href="https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/">curate
the best posts</a> and order
them by topic, something still sorely missing for blogs like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QaDwBio8MLqRvTREH/usd10k-bounty-read-and-compile-robin-hanson-s-best-posts">Overcoming
Bias</a>
and <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal Revolution</a> or
<a href="https://www.econlib.org/econlog/">econlog</a>. How much value is provided
by reading the whole Marginal Revolution archives or all posts Robin
Hanson has ever written? A lot, probably, but with extremely low
value per post (compare to a post by Gwern, such as the one on <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced
repetition</a>—comprehensive,
up-to-date, all in one place; built up over <em>10 years</em>). I should know,
I started reading the Marginal Revolution archives and quickly abandoned
the endeavour, I persisted a bit longer with Overcoming Bias, reading
at least all posts from 2006 and half of the posts from 2007.</p>
<p>Additionally, blogs fall prey to <a href="">bit rot</a>, in which facts fall out
of date, replication crises happen, new relevant ideas are discovered,
better citations become available &amp;c; they also incentivize a focus
on new posts (most blogs show posts chronologically by default,
burying old ones in hard-to-navigate archives or with obscure tagging
systems). (Similar with software projects: unmaintained software is worth
less and less over time, especially when it is far down the technology
stack; the shiny new JavaScript framework is the most popular, even if
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery">jQuery</a> would do the trick ust
as well).</p>
<p>What advantage, if any, do blogs have over other media? Books can be (and
usually are) far more comprehensive and high-status, instant messaging
and social media are more engaging, but move from one fashionable topic
onto another, and imageboards—well, we <a href="ihttps://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rules-of-the-internet">don’t talk about imageboards
here</a>. Blogs
(or, in the best case, <a href="https://www.gleech.org/sites">sites</a>), allow for
content to be accumulated slowly, and still stay up to date, connecting
a larger network of ideas from a single person (in ways that wikis
usually don’t).</p>
<p>As with software projects, the first 80% of the work is finding the idea
and doing the work to have a basic prototype, the second 80% are writing
clearer explanations with images, citing the claims, updating the text
with new facts or arguments after they come out, and perhaps completely
rewriting it after it has turned out to be wrong.</p>
<h3 id="None"><a class="hanchor" href="#None">Did <strong>Anybody</strong> <em>Think</em> About The Incentives?</a></h3>
<p>We can then look at the prize from another lens: Which <a href="zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/08/measure/">algorithms’
measures</a> does this prize
increase? Surely not the one of people who are willing to put in a decade
into a post about spaced repetition, since one of the requirements is
that the blog should have been started at most 12 months ago (‽),
so the algorithms you incentivize is not “puts a lot of effort into a
blog”, but “puts a lot of effort into a blog as long as there is a
juicy prize at the finish line”. (The website states that only blogs
started “within the last 12 months” are eligible for the prize—does
that refer to the 12 months before the announcement of the prize, or
the date at which the prize is given out?)</p>
<p>Of the blogs that will win the prizes, how many of them will persist
<em>after</em> the prize is given out? Not many, I reckon.</p>
<p>Rewarding this kind of unmaintained one-shot content creates not epistemic
infrastructure (posts that come to fruition slowly, that potentially
will still be read in five years), but epistemic fireworks (or, in the
best case, epistemic tinder that sparks discussions).</p>
<h3 id="LongTerm_Prizes_for_New_Blogs"><a class="hanchor" href="#LongTerm_Prizes_for_New_Blogs">Long-Term Prizes for New Blogs</a></h3>
<p>This would be okay if it were a prize for blogs about current event or
news, but the website states that the blogs in question should “explore
themes related to effective altruism and longtermism” and that the
Effective Ideas team has “a particular interest in iconic blog posts
that stand the test of time.”</p>
<p>That, of course, makes perfect sense: You’d obviously like to exclude
anyone who has put any real effort into their blog in the past, and
prevent any possible evidence for which blogs and their posts actually
stand the test of time. After all, there’s nobody around who has already
shown some capability for working on things for a long time, right⸮</p>
<p>DID THEY NOT SEE THE IRONY OF PUTTING OUT A PRIZE LOOKING FOR BLOGS
FOCUSED ON LONGERMISM WITH POSTS THAT STAND THE TEST OF TIME, BUT EXCLUDE
ANY BLOG OLDER THAN 12 MONTHS? AM I GOING CRAZY?</p>

<p>Luckily, they include some blogs in the “A Few of Our Bloggers” section, so I can take a look at how well they have fared so far with regards to producing long-term content.</p>
<p>(If you are one of those bloggers, please don’t take this as an
indictment against your blogging abilities—but I’d like to do a
case study. I’d be delighted if you proved me wrong :-)). For the
time being, this will unfortunately be limited to collecting few
datapoints (number of posts, date of last post, length of post) and
rough impressions (in the long term, I plan to add all those posts to
<a href="https://niplav.github.io/texts_list.html">my collection</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ziggurat.substack.com/">Ziggurat</a>
<ul>
<li>3 posts (one of them an announcement post), decent length, last post April 7th 2022</li>
<li>Impression: Good potential, especially with the recent update.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.bridgetwilliams.blog/">Bridget Williams</a>

<li>2 posts, decent length, last post March 26th 2022</li>

<li>1 announcement post, quite short, last post March 7th 2022</li>

<li>36 posts/8 posts, appreciable length, last post on April 6th 2022</li>
<li>Impression: Now <em>this</em> is the kind of stuff that gets me excited. Sam, have you considered writing a <a href="https://www.gleech.org/sites">site</a>, not a a blog or a newsletter? Your book reviews would look <a href="https://gwern.net/reviews/Books">very good</a> on one page ;-). Verdict: Excellent.</li>

<ul>
<li>1 announcement post, very short, posted February 15th</li>
<li>Impression: Nothing here, similar to The Take Machine. Verdict: [REDACTED]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://basilhalperin.com/essays.html">Basil Halperin</a>
<ul>
<li>15 posts, quite long, last post March 31st 2022</li>
<li>Impression: I really like this blog: the first post is from 2013 (showing that the author is persistent, even if they’re a slow writer, but who am I to call that a vice!), the author <em>wants</em> to write a long site but doesn’t know it yet (seriously, look at the <a href="https://basilhalperin.com/essays/best-essays.html">best essays</a> page: add the other 6 posts to that, and it would work great as a landing page for the blog.) Verdict: We could be friends :-)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://handsandcities.com/">Hands and Cities</a>
<ul>
<li>46 posts, some of them extraordinarily long (I’ve been procrastinating on reading <a href="https://handsandcities.com/2022/01/30/on-infinite-ethics/">On Infinite Ethics</a> for quite a while now), last post March 24th 2022</li>
<li>Impression: Outstanding (and <em>a bit</em> depressing): The posts are more solid than anything I’ve ever written, on very interesting topics, with quotes from relevant poetry: This could be turned into a long site in a whim. Also an excellent illustration for why chronological archives often don’t make sense: There’s no reason why <a href="https://handsandcities.com/2021/06/21/on-the-limits-of-idealized-values/">this post</a> is deprioritised in the list of posts compared to <a href="https://handsandcities.com/2022/02/18/simulation-arguments/">this post</a>. However, I suspect that these posts will not be updated over time (:-/), which will slowly make them less useful (although this is less of a problem for <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NCzfvp7jmbouodsRP/integrating-the-lindy-effect">philosophy than for other disciplines</a>)—in ten years someone might stumble upon <a href="https://handsandcities.com/2021/08/27/can-you-control-the-past/">Can you control the past</a> and start scrolling, fascinatedly, an explorer in the ruins of a great ancient civilization.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Verdict: two webpages that aren’t actually blogs, two young (but
potentially promising) blogs with few posts, two medium-age blogs that
have <em>a lot</em> of content (to the degree that I fear the authors might burn
out or get disillusioned from the endeavour), and a very cute &amp; old site.</p>
<h2 id="CounterArguments"><a class="hanchor" href="#CounterArguments">Counter-Arguments</a></h2>
<p>I imagine the organizers of the Effective Ideas blog prize have several
objections, here’s two I can anticipate:</p>
<h3 id="Theres_Not_That_Many_Longtermist_Blogs_Around"><a class="hanchor" href="#Theres_Not_That_Many_Longtermist_Blogs_Around">There’s Not That Many Longtermist Blogs Around</a></h3>
<p>The prize exists explicitely to encourage new &amp; young writers, so
I imagine the organizers perceive a current lack of blogs about
longtermism and effective altruism (and related areas).</p>
<p>There certainly is no Marginal Revolution of effective altruism, and not
as many people comment on posts on the EA forum as on ACX open threads.</p>
<h4 id="Countercounterargument"><a class="hanchor" href="#Countercounterargument">Counter-counter-argument</a></h4>
<p>Is that true? To be honest, I don’t quite know: I recognize ~all blogs on
<a href="https://www.finmoorhouse.com/writing/ea-blogs">this page</a>, and most
on <a href="https://eablogs.net/">this blogroll</a>, but I would be a lying lier
telling dirty lies if I said I’d read any non-negligible fraction of
their posts. But I looking over those lists, I don’t get the impression
that there’s a dearth of blogs about effective altruism, but rather a
lack of discoverability or aggregation (why doesn’t everyone of those
post their texts to the EA forum?).</p>
<p>This is relevant: If there were very few EA blogs around, then it would
make sense to incentivize the creation of new ones. If many old and
semi-regularly updated EA blogs existed, but if they were just limited
by funding or time, it would make sense to incentivize those blogs to
increase their output (or reward them for their past contributions),
and encourage them to better curate their content.</p>
<h3 id="Blogs_are_for_Discourse"><a class="hanchor" href="#Blogs_are_for_Discourse">Blogs are for Discourse</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Further, we think EA needs more strong writers who can share key ideas
in prestigious and popular venues — to persuade people to work on
the most pressing issues of our time and to advance our thinking about
them. We want to incentivize EAs to develop those skills.</p>

<p>The goal of a blog, really, is not to produce really viable long-term
content—it’s often just about The Discourse™: Getting certain ideas
into public perception, making the EA perspective a more acceptable
stance in public perception. We want more people to at least <em>know</em> about
effective altruism, and most people don’t actually read a <a href="https://gwern.net/Embryo-selection">180 page about
iterated embryo selection</a>—a short
blog post is much more likely to be actually consumed by anyone (many
people I’ve talked to tell me they’ve never finished a Gwern post—sad,
of course, but understandable).</p>

<p>But then, blogs occupy an uncomfortable spot in the informational
ecosystem: The days of glory for blogging are unfortunately over, The
Discourse™ is happening on social media now, in Twitter threads and
Discord messages. All the substacks in the world will not change that
if you want to be plugged in, you might want to make YouTube videos
about effective altruism instead. (Sorry, the era of BoingBoing is not
coming back).</p>
<p>Alternatively, I could see an <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iaSmu3t3QKTfkyQqZ/the-altruist-proposal-for-an-ea-newspaper">EA
newspaper</a>
as a good idea: having an institutionalized content &amp; Discourse-producing

or <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/">Jacobin</a> will reach a
different kind of people who demand the air of respectability
of a newspaper—after all, <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/blogging-doubts.html">blogs are not <em>exactly</em>
high-status</a>

long sites: they just feel <em>classier</em>).</p>
<h2 id="Suggestions_for_Improvement"><a class="hanchor" href="#Suggestions_for_Improvement">Suggestions for Improvement</a></h2>
<p>Since I obviously have opinions about blogs, but don’t want to <em>just</em>
criticize other people’s hard work, here are some suggested improvements
I believe would be quite beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="Small_Changes"><a class="hanchor" href="#Small_Changes">Small Changes</a></h3>
<p>On the less invasive side, I can propose one small improvement:</p>
<h4 id="Drop_the_Age_Limit"><a class="hanchor" href="#Drop_the_Age_Limit">Drop the Age Limit</a></h4>
<p>The 12 month age limit in the current prize makes little sense: If
someone has been producing valuable content for a long time, they will
probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Effect">continue doing so</a>
for quite a while. The current prize is unfairly excluding past effort.</p>
<h3 id="Alternative_Prizes"><a class="hanchor" href="#Alternative_Prizes">Alternative Prizes</a></h3>
<p>There’s also more experimental structures available: Don’t
give out prizes; instead perform credit assignment for past work. <a href="http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2017/03/friends-can-change-the-world-or-request-for-social-technology-credit-assignment-rituals/">Zack M.
Davis</a>
outlines the idea in a personal context, transferring it to an
organizational one should be <em>reasonably</em> easy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I had an idea. You know how some people say we
should <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/01/be-a-charity-angel.html">fund the solutions to problems with after-the-fact
prizes</a>,
rather than picking a team in advance that we think might solve the
problem and funding them? What if … you did something like that,
but on a much smaller scale? A personal scale.</p>
<p>Like, suppose you’ve just successfully navigated a major personal
life crisis that could have gone much worse if it weren’t for some
of the people in your life (both thanks to direct help they provided
during the crisis, and things you learned from them that made you the
sort of person that could navigate the crisis successfully). These
people don’t and shouldn’t expect a reward (that’s what friends
are for) … but maybe you could reward them anyway (with a special
emphasis on people who helped you in low-status ways that you didn’t
understand at the time) in some sort of public ritual, to make them more
powerful and incentivize others to emulate them, thereby increasing the
<a href="http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/08/measure/">measure</a> of algorithms
that result in humans successfully navigating major personal life crises.</p>
<p>It might look something like this—  </p>
<p>• If you have some spare money lying around, set aside some of it for
rewarding the people you want to reward. If you don’t have any spare
money lying around, this ritual will be less effective! Maybe you should
fix that!<br/>
• Decide how much of the money you want to use to reward each of the
people you want to reward.  </p>
<p>(Note: giving away something as powerful as money carries risks of
breeding dependence and resentment if such gifts come to be expected! If
people know that you’ve been going through a crisis and anyone so much
as hints that they think they deserve an award, that person is missing
the point and therefore does not deserve an award.)</p>
<p>• Privately go to each of the people, explain all this, and give them
the amount of money you decided to give them. Make it very clear that this
is a special unilateral one-time award made for decision-theoretic reasons
and that it’s very important that they accept it in the service of your
mutual <a href="https://arbital.com/p/cev/">coherent extrapolated volition</a> in
accordance with the Bayes-structure of the universe. Refuse to accept
words of thanks (it’s not about you; it’s not about me; it’s about
credit-assignment). If they try to refuse the money, explain that you
will literally burn that much money in paper currency if they don’t take
it. (Shredding instead of burning is also acceptable.)<br/>
• Ask if they’d like to be publicly named and praised as having received
an award as part of the credit-assignment ritual. (Remember that it’s
quite possible and understandable and good that they might want to accept
the money, but not be publicly praised by you. After all, if you’re the
sort of person who is considering actually doing this, you’re probably
kind of weird! Maybe people don’t want to be associated with you!)<br/>
• To complete the ritual, publish a blog post naming the people and
the the awards they received. People who prefered not to be named should
be credited as Anonymous Friend A, B, C, &amp;c. Also list the amount of
money you burned or shredded if anyone foolishly rejected their award
in defiance of the Bayes-structure of the universe. Do not explain the
nature of the crisis or how the named people helped you. (You might want
to tell the story in a different post, but that’s not part of the ritual,
which is about credit-assignment.)  </p>
