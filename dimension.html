<h1 id="tSNE_and_UMAP_Dont_Produce_Clusters_on_Random_Data"><a class="hanchor" href="#tSNE_and_UMAP_Dont_Produce_Clusters_on_Random_Data">t-SNE and UMAP Don't Produce Clusters on Random Data</a></h1>
<p>Every once in a while, my corner of 𝕏
erupts in discussion about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction_algorithm">dimensionality reduction
techniques</a>,
usually in the context of some paper which visualizes high-dimensional
data and clearly shows clusters in the visualization. (Often, this has
to do with discussions about race or gender 🙄)</p>
<p>A common claim in those discussions is that dimensionality reduction
techniques like <a href="https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/">t-SNE</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction#Uniform_manifold_approximation_and_projection">UMAP</a>
tend to find clusters in random data, even if they're not <em>really
present</em>.</p>
<p>I think this is wrong in the strict sense
with unimodal distributions, although <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/263539/clustering-on-the-output-of-t-sne/264647">it's
sometimes correct in the case of multimodal or more structured
distributions</a>.
I'll generate 10k 2k-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution">uniformly
distributed</a>
samples, reduce them down to 2 dimensions, and plot
the result (code <a href="./code/dimension/code.jl">here</a> in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_programming_language">Julia</a>):</p>
<pre><code>using TSne, UMAP, Plots

datapoints=1000
dims=200

data=rand(datapoints, dims)

reduced=tsne(data)
reduced_umap=umap(transpose(data))

gui(scatter(reduced[:,1],reduced[:,2]))
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/dimension/tsne_plot.png"></p>
<pre><code>gui(scatter(reduced_umap[1,:],reduced_umap[2,:], color=:red))
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/dimension/umap_plot.png"></p>
<p>Changing the perplexity to 5 (default is 30 for t-SNE) changes
the clustering produced — no obvious <em>clustering</em>, but it leads to
structure being hallucinated, especially the tendency towards identifying
a cross-shaped pattern in the data, and imagining outliers where they
don't exist.</p>
<pre><code>reduced_5=tsne(data, 2, 0, 1000, 5.0)
gui(scatter(reduced_5[:,1],reduced_5[:,2], color=:green))
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/dimension/tsne_5_plot.png"></p>
<p>But—what if we have <em>more</em> dimensions than datapoints? Surely it
hallucinates structure in that case‼</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/dimension/tsne_moredims.png"></p>
<p>(In all cases with 1000 datapoints.)</p>
<p>And the same for UMAP:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/dimension/umap_moredims.png"></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/quetzal_rainbow/status/1868307804702069173">quetzal_rainbow
suggested</a>
I test it with data where half the dimensions are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-distribution">normally
distributed</a>
and the other half is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lognormal_Distribution">lognormally
distributed</a>.
Intuitively, the resulting dataset has the shape of a skewed hyperegg,
in which for half the dimensions the cross-section is spherical and for
the other half they extend much further in one direction than the other.</p>
<p>When reducing the dimensions, we see this for t-SNE on 1000 datapoints each:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/dimension/tsne_mixed_moredims.png"></p>
<p>And similarly for UMAP:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/dimension/umap_mixed_moredims.png"></p>
<p>The dimensionality reduction algorithms get executed on the same dataset
per dimensionality, which is why they have very similar outputs for
e.g. 16k dimensions: The generated dataset has a few outliers which end
up far away from the center of the dataset, and both t-SNE and UMAP pick
up on that. I find it pretty encouraging to see how two very different
algorithms find the same structure in the data.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmanning">steelmanned</a>
critique of these two algorithms could be that sometimes people
use dimensionality reduction techniques for clustering, instead
of separating visualization and clustering (such as via good ol'
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_Clustering">k-means</a>),
allegedly t-SNE is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_high-dimensional_data#Projection-based_clustering">sometimes used even for
clustering</a>.
I don't think that's a good idea, and propose the following slogan as
an alternative:</p>
<p><strong>Clustering <em>first</em>, dimensionality reduction <em>second</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Since:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cluster sizes in a t-SNE plot mean nothing […]
The basic message is that distances between well-separated clusters in
a t-SNE plot may mean nothing.</p>
