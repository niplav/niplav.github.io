<p><strong>I investigate whether the attention span of individual humans has
been falling over the last two decades (prompted by curiosity about
whether the introduction of the internet may be harmful to cognitive
performance). I find little direct work on the topic, despite its wide
appeal, but reviewing related research indicates that individual attention
spans might have been declining<code>$_{75\%}$</code>.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">Attention</a> is generally
divided into three distinct categories: <strong>sustained attention</strong>, which
is the consistent focus on a specific task or piece of information
over time (Wikipedia states that the span for sustained attention
has a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Leprechauns">leprechaun</a> figure of
10 minutes floating around); <strong>selective attention</strong>, which is
the ability to resist distractions while focusing on important
information while performing on a task (the thing trained during
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">mindfulness meditation</a>); and
<strong>alternating</strong> or <strong>divided attention</strong>, also known as the ability to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking">multitask</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Methods for assessing attention span:
<ul>
<li>Three online tests (probably devised by the authors (?), since no source is given) (n≈2000 Canadians). Very little information about the exact nature of the tests.
<ul>
<li>Sustained attention span: "Counting the number of times responds correctly identified an X occurring after an A."</li>
<li>Selective attention span: "Counting the number of times respondents correctly identified a change in the orientation of the rectangles"</li>
<li>Alternating attention span: "Calculating the difference in the time lapsed to perform a series of consecutive number or letter classification, compared to a mixture of number and letter classifications."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Neurological research: The same games/tests as above with the participants being measured with an EEG ("Results were reported as ACE (Attention, Connectivity, Encoding) scores, as well as the number of attention bursts") (n=112 Canadians)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Questions answered:
<ul>
<li>Sustained attention:
<ul>
<li><em>Do younger people perform worse on the sustained attention span test?</em>, Yes (31% high sustained attention for group aged 18-34, 34% for group aged 35-54, and 35% group aged 55+) (the methodology is wholly unclear here, though: how do we determine the group that has "high sustained attention span"? Did they perform any statisitical tests? If yes, which?).</li>
<li><em>Do people who report more technology usage (web browsing/multi-screen usage while online/social media usage/tech adoption) perform worse on the sustained attention span test?</em>, Yes. Light:medium:heavy usage for web browsing has 39%:33%:27% users with high sustained attention span, 36%:33%:27% for light:medium:heavy multi-screen usage, 36%:29%:23% for light:medium:heavy social media usage and 35%:31%:25% for light:medium:heavy tech adoption (though these numbers are basically not elaborated on).
Selective attention:</li>
<li><em>Do younger people perform worse on the selective attention span test?</em> No (34% high selective attention for group aged 18-34, 30% for group aged 35-54, and 35% group aged 55+).</li>
<li><em>Do people with high selective attention use fewer devices at the same time?</em> Yes (details p. 31).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternating attention:
<ul>
<li><em>Do younger people perform worse on the alternating attention span test?</em> No (36% high selective attention for group aged 18-34, 28% for group aged 35-54, and 36% group aged 55+).</li>
<li><em>Do people who report more technology usage (tech adoption/web browsing/multi-screen usage while online) perform worse on the alternating attention span test?</em> No, they seem to perform better: Light:medium:heavy tech adoption corresponds to 31%:39%:40% having high alternating attention spans, light:medium:heavy web browsing to 29%:34%:37% and multi-screening while online to 27%:32%:37%.</li>
<li><em>Do people who use social media more have higher Attention/Connection/Encoding scores on EEG measurements?</em>, Not quite: "Moderate users of social media are better at multi-tasking than lower users. But, when crossing into the top quartile of social media usage, scores plummet."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is a marketing statement wearing the skinsuit of a previously great paper, it would be awesome if they released their exact methodology (tests performed, data collected, exact calculations &amp; code written). I can smell that they actually put effort into the research: Creating an actual test instead of just asking respondents about their attention spans, doing EEG measurements of over 100 people, for 3 different types of attention…come on! Just put out there what you did!</li>

<ul>
<li>Questions answered:
<ul>
<li>Is self-reported attention span related to the number of social media accounts?, No, not statistically significant (F(2, 206)=0.1223, p&gt;0.05) (via a one-way ANOVA)</li>
<li>Is self-reported attention span related to whether a respondent mainly uses a mobile phone or a computer?, No, not statistically significant (P(2,713)=0.923, p&gt;0.05) (via a one-way ANOVA)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Method for assessing attention span: Questionnaire developed by the authors based on Conners 2004 (reliability: α=0.786)</li>

<ul>
<li>Questions answered:
<ul>
<li><em>How long does any particular hashtag stay in the group of the top 50 most used hashtags? Specifically, how has that number developed from 2013 to 2016?</em>, "in 2013 a hashtag stayed within the top 50 for 17.5 hours on average, a number which gradually decreases to 11.9 hours in 2016", and "The average maximum popularity <code>$\langle L(t_{\hbox{peak}}) \rangle$</code> on one day <code>$t_{\hbox{peak}}$</code> stays relatively constant, while the average gradients <code>$\langle ΔL \rangle$</code> in positive and negative direction become steeper over the years."</li>
<li><em>Do things become more popular faster over time? That is, when e.g. a movie is gaining popularity, did it take longer to become popular in 1985 than it did in 2018?</em>, Broadly yes (the trends holds for popularity of hashtags in tweets (2013-2016)/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n-gram">n-grams</a> in books (1900-2004)/number of theaters that movies were screened in (1985-2018)/topics for search queries on Google (2010-2017)/Reddit comments on posts (2010-2015)/citations of publications (1990-2015)/daily traffic for Wikipedia articles (2012-2017)). Again the length of the time at the peak mostly didn't change (except in the case of Wikipedia articles, where the time at the peak <em>shrunk</em>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Method for assessing attention span: Time that specific pieces of information (hashtags/n-grams/Reddit submissions &amp;c) were popular</li>
<li>While it investigates a question different from the one I have, this paper seems good and trustworthy to me, while supporting a suspicion I've had (observing that the lifecycle of e.g. memes has apparently sped up significantly). I'd be interested in seeing whether the same process holds for internet communities I'm part of (for example on votes LessWrong and the EA Forum or forecasts on Metaculus).</li>

<h2 id="Why_Are_They_So_Inadequate"><a class="hanchor" href="#Why_Are_They_So_Inadequate">Why Are They So Inadequate?</a></h2>
<hr/>
<p>When asking the question "have attention spans been declining",
we'd ideally want the same test measung all those three aspects of
attention (and not just asking people about their <a href="https://guzey.com/statistics/dont-believe-self-reported-data/">perception via
surveys</a>),
performed anually on large random samples of humans over decades,
ideally with additional information such as age, sex, intelligence (or
alternatively educational attainment), occupation etc. I'm personally
most interested in the development of sustained attention, and less so
in the development of selective attention. But I have not been able to
find such research, and in fact there is apparently no agreed upon test
for measuring attention span in the first place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She studies attention in drivers and witnesses to crime and says the
idea of an "average attention span" is pretty meaningless. "It's very
much task-dependent. How much attention we apply to a task will vary
depending on what the task demand is."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>— Simon Maybin quoting Dr. Gemma Briggs, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38896790">“Busting the attention span myth”</a>, 2017</em></p>
<p>(So, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/11/does-the-glasgow-coma-scale-exist-do-comas/">similar to
comas</a>,
attention span doesn't exist…)</p>
<p>When asking whether attention spans have been declining, we'd
ideally want to have experiments from up to 2019: close enough
to the present to see whether there is a downward trend (a bit
more than a decade after the introduction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iPhone_(1st_generation)">iPhone in
2007</a>),
but before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19
pandemic</a> which might
be a huge confounder, or just have accelerated existing trends (which
we can probably check in another 2 years).</p>
<p>A commonly cited resource on the decline of attention span is Gausby et
al. 2015 from Microsoft research. I'm not a huge fan of the study: It's
already seven years old, which in internet years means we should prepare
for its cryopreservation; its glossy makeup, corporate sponsoring and
being directed at marketing professionals doesn't quite inspire confidence
in me, and it is not very precise (often speaking of "% high sustained
attention by demographic", without specifying what "high" is supposed
to mean here). Add to that that they cite a probably <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38896790">fallacious figure
of a 8-second</a> attention span
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twyman's_law">Twyman's law</a> in action).</p>
<p>Having said all that, Gausby et al. 2015 states self-described
heavy social-media users and early tech adopters do significantly
worse in terms of sustained attention than lighter social-media
users (though they don't make clear whether they controlled
for age, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span#Human_Attention_Span_Over_Time">increases with age until the early
40's</a>).</p>

to attract individuals and hold their attention long enough for people
to read or watch messages such as work memos, advertisements, etc.</p>
