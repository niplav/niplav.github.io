<p><strong>I investigate whether the attention span of individual humans has
been falling over the last two decades (prompted by curiosity about
whether the introduction of the internet may be harmful to cognitive
performance). I find little direct work on the topic, despite its wide

<p>In what might be just the age-old regular
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephebiphobia">ephebiphobia</a>,
claims have been raised that individual attention spans <a href="#Appendix_A_Claims_That_Attention_Spans_Have_Been_Declining">have been
declining</a>—not
just among adolescents but also among the general population. If so,
this would be quite worrying: Much of the economy in industrialized
societies is compromised of knowledge work, and knowledge work depends
on attention to the task at hand; switching between tasks too often
might prevent progress on complicated and difficult tasks.</p>
<p>I became interested in the topic after
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/11/health/short-attention-span-wellness/index.html">seeing</a>
<a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2021/12/22/covid-attention-span-exhaustion/8926439002/">several</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/amix011/status/1603927882459672576">claims</a>
that e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Generation Z</a>
allegedly has lower attention spans, observing myself and how I
struggled to get any work done when having an internet connection, and
reports of others online of having the same problem.<!--I was finally
convinced to actually investigate™ the topic after making [a comment on
LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Bfq6ncLfYdtCb6sat/i-converted-book-i-of-the-sequences-into-a-zoomer-readable?commentId=7SDEJibu5hedqqNmo)
asking the question and receiving a surprisingly large amount of
upvotes.--></p>
<p>The exact question being asked is:</p>
<p><strong>"Have the attention spans of individuals on neutral tasks (that is,
tasks that are not specifically intended to be stimulating) declined
from 2000 to the present?"</strong></p>
<p>(One might also formulate it as "Is there an equivalent of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_Effect#Possible_end_of_progression">Reversed
Flynn Effect</a>”
for attention span?".) I am not particularly wedded to the specific
timeframe, though the worries mentioned above assert that this has
become most stark during the last decade or so, attributing the change
to widespread social media/smartphone/internet usage. Data from before
2000 or just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aughts">aughts</a>
would be less interesting. The near-global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns">COVID-19
lockdows</a>
could provide an especially enlightening <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment">natural
experiment</a>: Did
social media usage increase (my guess: yes<code>$_{90\%}$</code>), and if so, did
attention spans decrease at the same time (or with a lag) (my guess:
also yes<code>$_{75\%}$</code>), but I don't think anyone has the data on that <em>and</em>
wants to share it.</p>
<p>Ideally want to have experiments from ~2000 up to 2019: close enough to
the present to see whether there is a downward trend (a bit
more than a decade after the introduction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iPhone_(1st_generation)">iPhone in
2007</a>),
but before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19
pandemic</a> which might
be a huge confounder, or just have accelerated existing trends (which
we can probably check in another 2 years).</p>
<p>I am mostly interested in the attention
span of individual humans and not groups: <a href="./doc/psychology/attention_span/accelerating_dynamics_of_collective_attention_lorenz-spreen_et_al_2019.pdf" title="Accelerating dynamics of collective attention">Lorenz-Spreen et al.
2019</a> investigate the
development of a construct they call "collective attention" (and indeed
find a decline), but that seems less economically relevant than individual
attention span. I am also far less interested in self-perception of
attention span, give me data from a proper <a href="http://www.careergym.com/psychometric_glossary/power_test">power-</a> or <a href="http://www.careergym.com/psychometric_glossary/speed_test">speed-test</a>, cowards!</p>
<p>So the question I am asking is not</p>
<ul>
<li>"Does more social media/internet usage cause decreased attention spans?"</li>
<li>"Does more social media/internet usage correlate with decreased attention spans?"</li>
<li>"Does more social media/internet usage correlate with people reporting having shorter attention spans?"</li>
<li>"Did collective attention spans decrease?"</li>
</ul>
<p>but simply</p>
<ul>
<li>Have individual attention spans been declining for the last 25 years?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How_Is_Attention_Span_Defined"><a class="hanchor" href="#How_Is_Attention_Span_Defined">How Is Attention Span Defined?</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention">Attention</a> is generally
divided into three distinct categories: <strong>sustained attention</strong>,
which is the consistent focus on a specific task or piece of
information over time (Wikipedia states that the span for sustained
attention has a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Leprechauns">leprechaun</a>
figure of 10 minutes floating around, elaborated on in <a href="./doc/psychology/attention_span/attention_during_lectures_beyond_ten_minutes_wilson_korn_2007.pdf">Wilson &amp;
Korn 2007</a>); <strong>selective attention</strong>, which is
the ability to resist distractions while focusing on important
information while performing on a task (the thing trained during
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">mindfulness meditation</a>);
and <strong>alternating</strong> or <strong>divided attention</strong>, also known as the ability to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking">multitask</a>.</p>
<!--Alternative partitioning in *arousal*, *capacity* and *selectity*. See
Plude et al., 1994 p. 4-->
<p>When asking the question "have attention spans been declining",
we'd ideally want the same test measuring all those three aspects of
attention (and not just asking people about their <a href="https://guzey.com/statistics/dont-believe-self-reported-data/" title="Don't believe self-reported data (Alexey Guzey, 2020)">perception via
surveys</a>),
performed anually on large random samples of humans over decades,
ideally with additional information such as age, sex, intelligence (or
alternatively educational attainment), occupation etc. I'm personally
most interested in the development of sustained attention, and less so
in the development of selective attention. But I have not been able to
find such research, and in fact there is apparently no agreed upon test
for measuring attention span in the first place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She studies attention in drivers and witnesses to crime and says the
idea of an "average attention span" is pretty meaningless. "It's very
much task-dependent. How much attention we apply to a task will vary
depending on what the task demand is."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>— Simon Maybin quoting Dr. Gemma Briggs, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38896790">“Busting the attention span myth”</a>, 2017</em></p>
<p>So, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/11/does-the-glasgow-coma-scale-exist-do-comas/">similar to
comas</a>,
attention span doesn't exist…sure, <a href="https://unremediatedgender.space/2019/Dec/on-the-argumentative-form-super-proton-things-tend-to-come-in-varieties/index.html" title='On the Argumentative Form "Super-Proton Things Tend to Come In Varieties'>super-proton things come in

psychologists, do your job and don't just
<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/explain-worship-ignore" title="Explain/Worship/Ignore?">worship</a>
complexity.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should soften my tone, as this perspective appears elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] Gould suggests the metaphor of a dense bush whose branches
are periodically pruned by nature. This allows for paallel evolutionary
sequences, some of which are adaptive and others not — at any moment in
time only the tips of adaptive branches are in evidence, the pruned ones
cannot be seen. Thus rather than being direct descendants of primitive
hominids, for example, huankind would have evolved along a separate but
parallel line from other primates.<br/>
Might the ontogeny of selective attention recapitulate this theme? That
is, rather than selective attention comprising a single construct
with a fixed ontogenic plan, might it be better conceptualized as
a multidimensional construct with separat, parallel developmental
trajectories for different components. To carry the analogy still
further, might the specific developmental progression for a particular
component of selective attention be determined by the adaptive fit of that
component with the individual's ‘environmental press’? Although such
a conjecture rekindles the tened of <em>ontogeny recapitulates phylogney</em>
long since abandoned in physiological development (e.g., Dixon and Lerner,
1985), we suggest that it may nonetheless provide an overarching framework
within which to cast life-span research and theory on the development
of selective attention.</p>

<p>One of my hopes was that there is a canonical and well-established (and
therefore, ah, <em>tested</em>) test for attention span (or just attention)
à la the IQ test for <em>g</em>: If so, I would've been able to laboriously go
through the literature on attention, extract the individual measurements
(and maybe even acquire some datasets) and perform a meta-analysis.</p>
<p>I attempted to find a survey or review paper on attention span, but
was unsuccessful in my quest, so I resulted to collecting metrics for
attention span from different papers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./doc/psychology/attention_span/attention_spans_gausby_et_al_2015.pdf">Gausby 2015</a>

<li>Three online tests (probably devised by the authors (?), since no source is given) (n≈2000 Canadians). Very little information about the exact nature of the tests.

<li>Sustained attention span: "Counting the number of times responds correctly identified an X occurring after an A."</li>
<li>Selective attention span: "Counting the number of times respondents correctly identified a change in the orientation of the rectangles"</li>
<li>Alternating attention span: "Calculating the difference in the time lapsed to perform a series of consecutive number or letter classification, compared to a mixture of number and letter classifications."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Neurological research: The same games/tests as above with the participants being measured with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">EEG</a> ("Results were reported as ACE (Attention, Connectivity, Encoding) scores, as well as the number of attention bursts") (n=112 Canadians)</li>

<li><a href="./doc/psychology/attention_span/the_development_of_selective_attention_plude_et_al_1994.pdf">Plude et al. 1994</a> review how selective attention develops during a human life. For measuring attention, they mainly focus on studies using reaction time as a metric—the speed at which an action occurs as a result of a changing stimulus: eye movement patterns of infants, simple tests such as pressing a button on a changing (often visual) stimulus, the influence of irrelevant visual stimuli at the periphery on a task performed at the centre of the visual field, judging similarity of stimuli at various distances in the visual field<!--Enns and Girgus, 1985-->, responding to a target stimulus surrounded by interfering distractor stimuli, and determining whether a visual target item is present or absent<!--TODO: continue-->. They also mention skin conductance (measuring arousal)<!--TODO: continue-->.

<ul>
<li>They also mention studies investigating the time required for attentional switching in acoustic contexts: "Pearson and Lane (1991a) studied the time course of the attention-shifting process between lists and also found large age-related improvements between 8 and 11 years. Whereas 8-year-olds required more than 3.5 s to completely switch from monitoring one list to another, 11-year-olds and adults appeared to complete the switch in less than 2.5 seconds."</li>

<li><em>Do things become more popular faster over time? That is, when e.g. a movie is gaining popularity, did it take longer to become popular in 1985 than it did in 2018?</em>, Broadly yes (the trends holds for popularity of hashtags in tweets (2013-2016)/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n-gram">n-grams</a> in books (1900-2004)/number of theaters that movies were screened in (1985-2018)/topics for search queries on Google (2010-2017)/Reddit comments on posts (2010-2015)/citations of publications (1990-2015)/daily traffic for Wikipedia articles (2012-2017)).

<p>Compared to other feats that psychology is accomplishing, finding out
whether individual attention spans are declining appears to be of medium
difficulty, so I'll try to outline how this could be accomplished: Find
a good instrument for measuring attention span, and then apply that
instrument on random population samples for several years.</p>
<h3 id="How_Might_One_Measure_Attention_Span"><a class="hanchor" href="#How_Might_One_Measure_Attention_Span">How Might One Measure Attention Span</a></h3>
<p><a href="#How_Do_We_Measure_Attention_Span">I have not been able to find</a>
a standard instrument for measuring attention span which returns
a scalar or vector describing the attention span of an individual
(optimally returning the number of seconds for the average attention
span)—it appears that most published papers on the topic
use survey data (which I fear to fall to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social-desirability%0Abias">social desirability
bias</a>) or behavioral cues (which I suspect
are quite noisy), with the exception of <a href="./doc/psychology/attention_span/attention_spans_gausby_et_al_2015.pdf">Gausby
2015</a>,
who didn't explain their instruments in great detail.</p>
<p>(Note that I'm not a psychometrician, but I like speculating about things,
so the ideas below might contain subtle and glaring mistakes. Noting them
down here anyway because I might want to implement them at some point.)</p>
<p>It seems relatively easy to measure attention span with a power- or
speed-test, via one of three methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Present a stimulus, change the stimulus and let the test subject report the change in stimulus; this results in two numbers: the time between the stimulus being initially being presented and the time it was changed (let's call this value <code>t_change</code>), and the time between the change of the stimulus and the reporting of the change (calling this value <code>t_report</code>). Performing this test with different value of <code>t_change</code> should result in different values of <code>t_report</code>. There is a <code>t_change</code> for which <code>t_report</code> falls over a threshold value, that <code>t_change</code> can be called the attention span.

<ol>
<li>This method has some disadvantages:

<ol>
<li>It needs a change in stimulus that requires selective attention to notice, but changing e.g. visual stimuli involves motion, which direct attention. (Idea: have a colored stimulus continuously changing color, and a reference color, once the stimulus has the reference color, the subject is supposed to report; avoiding sudden changes in visual stimuli.)</li>
<li>The method would require many samples to find the <code>t_change</code> for which <code>t_report</code> falls over the threshold value.</li>
<li>Performing the test multiple times in a row might induce mental fatigue, decreasing attention span</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Let the test subject engage in a mentally draining exercise like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_test">Stroop test</a> with some performance measure. I would the performance to decline over time, and one could define a threshold value at which the subject "is no longer paying attention".</li>
<li>Let the subject observe a neutral stimulus while measuring some indicator of attention (such as arousal via skin conductivity or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">default mode network</a> being inactive), when the measured value falls under/over a threshold the subject has "lost attention".

<p>Such an instrument would of course need to have different forms of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(psychometrics)">reliability</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(psychometrics)">validity</a>,
and I think it would probably work best as a power test or a speed test.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how such a test would relate to standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient">IQ
tests</a>: would it
simply measure a subpart of <em>g</em>, completely independent or just partially
related to it?</p>
<h3 id="Performing_the_Study"><a class="hanchor" href="#Performing_the_Study">Performing the Study</a></h3>
<p>Once one has a suitable instrument for measuring attention
span, one can every year (or every second year) for a couple
of years pick a random sample from the population (not of
the same set of people, though, since attention span <a href="./doc/psychology/attention_span/the_development_of_selective_attention_plude_et_al_1994.pdf">increases with
age</a>),
e.g. via the internet if the test can be done online,
save the data and finally apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_regression">cross-sectional
regression</a>
or a fancier statistical technique I don't know to find out whether
attention spans have declined between the measurements.</p>

Why Are Existing Studies So Inadequate?

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a class="hanchor" href="#Conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Given the amount of interest the question about shrinking attention spans
has received, I was surprised to not find a knockdown study of the type
I was looking for, and instead many different investigations that were
either not <em>quite</em> answering the question I was asking or too shoddy
(or murky) to be trusted. I seems likely to me that individual attention
spans have declined (I'd give it ~70%), but I wouldn't be surprised if
the decline was relatively small, noisy &amp; dependent on specific tests.</p>
<p>So—why hasn't anyone investigated this question to satisfaction
yet? After all, it doesn't seem to me to be extremely difficult to do
(compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider">other</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Eradication">things</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">science</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_(sheep)">has</a>)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold">accomplished</a>),
there is pretty clearly a lot of media attention on
the question (so much so that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38896790">a likely incorrect number
proliferates</a> far &amp; wide),
it appears economically and strategically relevant to me (especially
sustained attention is <em>probably</em> an important factor in knowledge work,
I'd guess?) and it slots more or less into cognitive psychology.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why this hasn't happened yet (and consider
this text evidence for a partial violation of <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/04/tyler-cowens-three-laws.html">Cowen's 2nd
law</a>).
The reasons I can think of is that one would need to first find a good
test for determining attention span, which is some work in itself,
be relatively patient (since the test would need to be re-run at least
twice with a &gt;1 year pause, for which the best grant structure might not
exist), there are many partial investigations into the topic, making it
appear like it's solved, and perhaps there just aren't enough cognitive
psychologists around to investigate all the interesting questions that
come up.</p>
<p>So I want to end with a call to action: If you have the capacity to
study this problem, there is room for improvement in the existing
literature! Attention spans could be important, but we don't know how
to measure then, and many people claim that they're declining, but are
too sure about it. False numbers are widely cited, meaning that correct
numbers might be cited even more widely!</p>
<p>Consider your incentives :-).</p>

<p>Today, individuals are constantly on an information overload from
both the quantity of information available and the speed of which
information gets into the hands of individuals through advertising and
multimedia. Attention deficits tend to be increasing as it is challenging
to attract individuals and hold their attention long enough for people
to read or watch messages such as work memos, advertisements, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Big data plays an important role in the development of microlearning. In
the age of big data, human’s attention span is decreasing. As per Hebert
(1971), “what information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the
attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a
poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently
among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it”
(p. 41). An example of short attention span in the age of big data can
be found in the music industry, as per (Gauvin, 2017), the average time
that passed before the audience would hear the vocals on any radio song
was 23 s, today the average intro is just 5 s long. Wertz (2017) also
suggested that 40% of users are likely to abandon a website if it does
not load within three seconds or less. Furthermore, a survey (Gausby,
2015) conducted by Microsoft indicated that the average attention span
of a human dropped from 12 to eight seconds, which means shorter than
a goldfish. Given the average human attention span is decreasing,
microlearning becomes more and more important because it emphasises
short learning duration.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all too many of us are having “squirrel”
days, according to Dr. Gloria Mark, a professor of
informatics at the University of California, Irvine, who
studies how digital media impacts our lives. In her new book,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Attention-Span-Finding-Fighting-Distraction/dp/1335449418">“Attention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and
Productivity,”</a>
Mark explained how decades of research has tracked the decline of the
ability to focus.</p>
<p>“In 2004, we measured the average attention on a screen to be 2½
minutes,” Mark said. “Some years later, we found attention spans to
be about 75 seconds. Now we find people can only pay attention to one
screen for an average of 47 seconds.”</p>
<p>Not only do people concentrate for less than a minute on any one screen,
Mark said, but when attention is diverted from an active work project,
it also takes about 25 minutes to refocus on that task.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tech-savvy users often say that the way the modern internet
works has made it so that people’s attention spans are
getting shorter every single day but the truth behind this
story is rather tough to ascertain. However, recent data from
<a href="https://www.similarweb.com/corp/reports/2020-digital-trends-lp/">SimilarWeb</a>
indicates that people definitely are suffering from shorter attention
spans, and what’s more is that these attention spans are shortening at a
pretty rapid pace when you take into account the numerous factors that are
coming into play, all of which serve some kind of purpose in this trend.</p>
<p>If you look at the data for how long users spend on websites before
navigating away, for the most part the trend has been that these times
are remaining more or less stable on web based browsing, but if you
look at the trend for mobile browsing between the years 2017 and 2019
you would see that there is a drop of about 11 seconds in the average
time spent on a website. When you take into account the fact that mobile
browsing is starting to become a lot more popular and in many ways has
become the preferred form of browsing for people on the internet, the
change is a lot more drastic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, as much as technology can be used as an effective learning
tool inside and outside the classroom, there’s no denying that one of
the biggest challenges faced by educators today is the distraction posed
by social media. <strong>Students are distracted by their phones during class,
and even without that distraction, the time they spend on social media
outside the classroom has an impact on their attention spans</strong>.</p>
