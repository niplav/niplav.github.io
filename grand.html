<p>The citation 684 is for "Gravitationally redshifted absorption lines in

<p>Perhaps use quotation marks around "civilization"
here—this feels like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%94mention_distinction">mention more than a

<blockquote>
<p>I will be using the term civilization not in the narrow high culture

2020</a>
and my <a href="./range_and_forecasting_accuracy.html">own investigation</a>
don&#39;t come to firm conclusions, mostly because of
a dearth of good long-term forecasting data. <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/how-feasible-long-range-forecasting">Muehlhauser
2019</a>
also laments the lack of long-term forecasts that are precise enough to
be checked. I think later in the book there will be talk about why less
accurate forecasts should be expected in dynamical systems, and I look
forward to that discussion.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t yet done a full review of that field yet, and my guess is that
there are much better references out there (maybe even on my hard drive).</p>

<p>[Stanislaw Lem — Summa Technologiae, comments on prognostication]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a work by Lem which I have only been able to find references
to in German. It&#39;s called "Das Katastrophenprinzip: Die Welt as
Holocaust" (Stanisław Lem, 1983). It gives an interesting perspective
on predictability, stating that the universe is <em>less</em> predictable in
the short term than in the long term. This feels related to notions of
sophistication from complexity theory, which try to capture the property
of being complex but not random.</p>

improving increasingly rapidly since the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>Also relevant to 1.2.2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pessimistic possibility is that the set of people skilled in core
competences is so small compared to the overall population today that many
key technologies would be lost in a fall of civilization. An optimistic
counterargument may be that in this case many flock to the frarmer or
smith to learn their skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an investigation into such global collapse at
current civilizational levels causing human extinction, see <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GsjmufaebreiaivF7/what-is-the-likelihood-that-civilizational-collapse-would">Rodriguez

It broadly finds that recovery appears likely in scenarios where less
than 99.9% of all humans die, and finds extinction unlikely unless more
than 99.999% of all humans die.</p>

close to a human neck, and the wages aren&#39;t high enough for there to
be significant pressure for automation). I&#39;d maybe pick legal advice &#38;
