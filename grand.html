<p>Performing more than a <strong>google</strong> (10<sup>100</sup>) computations</p>

<p>I think it is supposed to be

<blockquote>
<p>Ord and Cotton-Barrett defined “An existential eucatastrophe is an
event which causes there to be much more expected value after the event
than before.” [684]²</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The citation 684 is for "Gravitationally redshifted absorption lines in
the x-ray burst spectra of a neutron star", but I think it should be 685,
"Existential risk and existential hope: definitions". This off-by-one
pattern repeats itself throughout my copy of the book.</p>

<p>The usage of the term civilization in this book needs to be
disambiguated.  Civilization can be used to denote complex societies
with features such as irrigation, urban areas, social stratification,
symbolic systems of communication, division of labour etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps use quotation marks around "civilization"
here—this feels like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%94mention_distinction">mention more than a
use</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will be using the term civilization not in the narrow high culture
sense but to denote <strong>as</strong> a cohesive, long-range (social) structure
with a high degree of coordination</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same with quotation here, also the "as" feels stumbly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Near-term is more predictable and hence conclusions are more likely

</blockquote>
<p>I don't know of a good resource that firmly establishes this. <a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/data-on-forecasting-accuracy-across-different-time-horizons">Dillon
2020</a>
and my <a href="./range_and_forecasting_accuracy.html">own investigation</a>
don't come to firm conclusions, mostly because of
a dearth of good long-term forecasting data. <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/how-feasible-long-range-forecasting">Muehlhauser
2019</a>
also laments the lack of long-term forecasts that are precise enough to
be checked. I think later in the book there will be talk about why less
accurate forecasts should be expected in dynamical systems, and I look
forward to that discussion.</p>
<p>I haven't yet done a full review of that field yet, and my guess is that
there are much better references out there (maybe even on my hard drive).</p>

<p>[Stanislaw Lem — Summa Technologiae, comments on prognostication]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a work by Lem which I have only been able to find references
to in German. It's called "Das Katastrophenprinzip: Die Welt as
Holocaust" (Stanisław Lem, 1983). It gives an interesting perspective
on predictability, stating that the universe is <em>less</em> predictable in
the short term than in the long term. This feels related to notions of
sophistication from complexity theory, which try to capture the property
of being complex but not random.</p>

<a href="http://lukemuehlhauser.com/three-wild-speculations-from-amateur-quantitative-macrohistory/" title="Three wild speculations from amateur quantitative macrohistory">Muehlhauser

and <a href="http://lukemuehlhauser.com/industrial-revolution/" title="How big a deal was the Industrial Revolution?">Muehlhauser
2017b</a>,
which find that along 5 different metrics, human well-being has been
improving increasingly rapidly since the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>Also relevant to 1.2.2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pessimistic possibility is that the set of people skilled in core
competences is so small compared to the overall population today that many
key technologies would be lost in a fall of civilization. An optimistic
counterargument may be that in this case many flock to the frarmer or
smith to learn their skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an investigation into such global collapse at
current civilizational levels causing human extinction, see <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GsjmufaebreiaivF7/what-is-the-likelihood-that-civilizational-collapse-would">Rodriguez
2020</a>.
It broadly finds that recovery appears likely in scenarios where less
than 99.9% of all humans die, and finds extinction unlikely unless more
than 99.999% of all humans die.</p>

<p>Word storage is repeated, perhaps use another term? Maybe use "safety for"

don't know of any dataset that estimates the age of such eternal flames,
and their failure rates.</p>

<p>I personally <em>do</em> feel a sense of loss at languages, species,
cultures &amp; ecosystems going extinct. (I think it's sad trilobites
&amp; opabinia regalis with its five eyes are gone, and would like to
revive them, even though this conflicts with wild-animal suffering
concerns.) Similarly, projections that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1096546">by 2050 &gt;90% of all languages
will have gone extinct</a>
seem like a tragedy to me, and I like the fact that there are (some)
language revitalization and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FirstVoices">language</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAC">documentation</a> projects underway.</p>
