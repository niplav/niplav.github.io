<p>Consider an agent which displays (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann-Morgenstern_utility_theorem">von
Neumman-Morgenstern</a>)
inconsistent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference">preferences</a>,
for example choosing two incompatible
options in the two scenarios in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_paradox">Allais
paradox</a>, or reliably
displaying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory)">cycles</a>
in its actions (detecting which actions are in fact caused by
inconsistent preferences, and not just exotic ones from weird
abstractions, is considered a separate problem here). We might want
to interact with that agent, e.g. trade with it, help it (or exploit
it), or generally know how it will act But how to go about that if the
agent displays inconsistent preferences? Perhaps it might even be the
case that humans are such agents, and find ourselves in a conundrum:
we know our preferences are inconsistent and reliably exploitable,
and that agents with such preferences <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/FYMiCeXEgMzsB5stm/p/RQpNHSiWaXTvDxt6R">reliably fare worse in the
world</a>,
we might want to change that.</p>

<p>A possible approach to this problem has two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find ways to represent inconsistent preferences with a mathematical structure which can encode all possible violations of the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms in all their combinations.</li>
<li>Then turn those inconsistent preferences into consistent ones, and then inform the agent about these inconsistencies and their optimal resolutions (or, in the case of trying to help the agent, then enacting these preferences in the real world).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Mathematical Formulation of the Problem</h2>

<p>Define a set of possible (von Neumann-Morgenstern) inconsistent
preferences over a set <code>$W$</code> of worlds as <code>$\not\curlyvee$</code>, and the set
of consistent preferences over those worlds as <code>$\curlyvee$</code>. Elements
from those sets are written as <code>$\succsim \in \not\curlyvee$</code> and
<code>$\succeq \in \curlyvee$</code>.</p>

<p>One way we could approach the problem is by trying to turn those
inconsistent preferences consistent, i.e. constructing a function <code>$t:
\not \curlyvee \mapsto \curlyvee$</code> that takes an inconsistent preference
<code>$\succsim$</code> and transforms it into a consistent preference <code>$\succeq$</code>,
while retaining as much of the original structure of the preference
as possible (it would make little sense if we replaced the original
preference relation with e.g. indifference over all options).</p>

<p>Formally, we want to find for some given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">distance
metric</a>
<code>$d: \not \curlyvee \times \curlyvee \mapsto ℝ$</code> a function
<code>$t$</code> so that</p>

<div>
    $$t= \underset{t}{\text{argmin }} d(\succsim, t(\succsim)) \\
    \succeq=t(\succsim)$$
</div>

<p>I call this function a <strong>turner</strong>, and sometimes call the results of
that function the <strong>set of turnings</strong> (an element from that set is a
<strong>turning</strong>). The names mostly chosen for not having been used yet in
mathematics, as far as I know, and because I want to be a little extra.</p>

<p>A solution to the problem of turning inconsistent preferences into
consistent ones then has these components:</p>

<ol>
<li>A mathematical structure for representing <code>$\not \curlyvee$</code> and <code>$\curlyvee$</code>
<ul>
<li>Inconsistent preferences over discrete options are represented via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graphs</a></li>
<li>Inconsistent preferences over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_(probability)">lotteries</a> of options are represented via
<ul>
<li>directed graphs over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex">probability simplices</a>
<ul>
<li>potentially more exotic structures such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphon">graphons</a> or results from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremal_graph_theory">extremal graph theory</a> might be relevant here, but I haven't investigated these in detail</li>
</ul></li>
<li>vector fields on probability simplices</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Weighted_graph">graphs with edge weights</a> in <code>$ℝ$</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A specification for <code>$t$</code>
<ul>
<li>In the case of discrete options, I propose adding and removing edges from the directed graph</li>
<li>In the case of lotteries I don't have yet any clear proposals</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A specification for <code>$d$</code>
<ul>
<li>In the case of discrete options, I propose using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_edit_distance">graph edit distance</a></li>
<li>In the case of lotteries I don't yet have any definite proposals</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Related Work</h2>

<p>This work is closely related to the investigations in <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ky988ePJvCRhmCwGo/using-vector-fields-to-visualise-preferences-and-make-them">Aird &amp; Shovelain
2020</a>
(so closely that even though I believe I re-invented the
approach independently, it might just be that I had read
their work &amp; simply forgotten it), and broadly related to
the value extrapolation framework outlined in <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i8sHdLyGQeBTGwTqq/value-extrapolation-concept-extrapolation-model-splintering">Armstrong
2022</a>.</p>

<h2>Discrete Case</h2>

<p>When we have discrete sets of worlds <code>$W$</code>, we can represent
an inconsistent preference over those worlds by using a directed graph
<code>$G_{\succsim}=(W,E_{\succsim} \subseteq W \times W)$</code>.
The presence of an edge <code>$(w_1, w_2)$</code> would mean that <code>$w_1 \succsim w_2$</code>,
that is <code>$w_1$</code> is preferred to <code>$w_2$</code>.</p>

<p>Mathematically, then, <code>$\not \curlyvee$</code> is the set of all possible
graphs with edges in <code>$W \times W$</code>, that is
<code>$\not \curlyvee=\{(W, E)| E \in \mathcal{P}(W \times W))\}$</code>).</p>

<p>The consistent equivalent to an inconsistent preference
represented by a directed graph would be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_graph">path
graph</a>
<code>$G_{\succeq}=(V, E_{\succeq})$</code> over the same set of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)">vertices</a> <code>$W$</code>.
The method for transforming <code>$G_{\succsim}$</code> into <code>$G_{\succeq}$</code> would be
by adding/deleting the minimal number of vertices from <code>$E_{\succsim}$</code>.</p>

<p>Mathematically, then <code>$\curlyvee$</code> is the set of transitive closures
of all possible path graphs that are encode permutations of <code>$W$</code>; <code>$\curlyvee=\{(V, E)^+ | E \in σ(W)\}$</code>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Consider the following directed graph:</p>

<p><img src="./img/turning/unbalanced_cycle.png" alt="A directed graph" title="A directed graph. It contains nodes {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} and edges a → b → c → e → f → g → b, c → d." /></p>

<p>Here, <code>$W=\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\}$</code>.</p>

<p>An edge from <code>$a$</code> to <code>$b$</code> means that <code>$a$</code> is preferred to <code>$b$</code>
(short <code>$a \succsim b$</code>). The absence of an edge between two
options means that those two options are, from the view of the agent,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparability">incomparable</a>.</p>

<p>It violates the two von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms for discrete options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Completeness is violated because for example options <code>$d$</code> and <code>$e$</code> are incomparable (and we don't merely have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indifference_curve">indifference</a> between these options)</li>
<li>Transitivity is violated because of the <code>$b → c → e → f → g → b$</code> loop</li>
</ul>

<!--TODO:
#### Recap: von Neumann-Morgenstern Axioms for Discrete Options

-----
-->

<p>A possible turned version of these preferences could then be the
following graph:</p>

<p><img src="./img/turning/turnubc_hyp_trans.png" alt="A messy graph." title="A messy graph. Vertices {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}. Edges are the transitive closure over the complete order a → b → c → d → e → f → g." /></p>

<p>This graph looks quite messy, but it's really just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transitive_closure">transitive
closure</a> of this graph:</p>

<p><img src="./img/turning/turnubc_hyp.png" alt="A path graph." title="A path graph. Vertices again {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}. Edges are a → b → c → d → e → f → g." /></p>

<p>Whether this is the "right" way to turn the previous inconsistent
preferences depends on the choice of distance metric we would like to use.</p>

<h3>Resolving Inconsistencies</h3>

<p>In some sense, we want to change the inconsistent preferences as little
as possible; the more we modify them, the more displayed preferences we
have to remove or change. Since the presence or absence of preferences
is encoded by the presence or absence of edges on the graph, removing
edges or adding new edges is equivalent to removing or adding preferences
(at the moment, we do <em>not</em> consider adding or removing vertices: we
stay firmly inside the agent's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontology</a>/world model).</p>

<p>Luckily, there is a concept in computer science called the graph-edit
distance: a measure for the difference between two graphs.</p>

<p>The set of possible editing operations on the graph varies, e.g. Wikipedia lists</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><strong>vertex insertion</strong> to introduce a single new labeled vertex to a graph.</li>
<li><strong>vertex deletion</strong> to remove a single (often disconnected) vertex from a graph.</li>
<li><strong>vertex substitution</strong> to change the label (or color) of a given vertex.</li>
<li><strong>edge insertion</strong> to introduce a new colored edge between a pair of vertices.</li>
<li><strong>edge deletion</strong> to remove a single edge between a pair of vertices.</li>
<li><strong>edge substitution</strong> to change the label (or color) of a given edge.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>—<a href="">English Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Edit_Distance">“Graph Edit Distance”</a>, 2021</em></p>

<p>Since we do not have labels on the edges of the graph, and have disallowed
the deletion or insertion of vertices, this leaves us with the graph
edit distance that uses edge insertion and edge deletion.</p>

<p>We can then write a simple pseudocode algorithm for
<code>$\succeq=f(\succsim)$</code>:</p>

<pre><code>turn(G≿=(W, E≿)):
    mindist=∞
    for L in perm(W):
        L=trans_closure(L)
        dist=ged(G≿, R)
        if dist&lt;mindist:
            R=L
            mindist=dist
    return R
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>perm(W)</code> is the set of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutations</a> on <code>W</code>,
<code>trans_closure(G)</code> is the transitive closure of a graph <code>G</code>, and <code>ged(G1,
G2)</code> is the graph edit distance from <code>G1</code> to <code>G2</code>.</p>

<p>Or, mathematically,</p>

<div>
    $$R=\underset{R \in σ(W)}{\text{argmin }}\text{GED}(R^+, G_{\succsim}))$$
</div>

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>Implementing this in Python 3 using the <a href="http://networkx.github.io/">networkx</a>
library turns out to be easy:</p>

<pre><code>import math
import networkx as nx
import itertools as it

def turn(graph):
    mindist=math.inf
    worlds=list(graph.nodes)
    for perm in it.permutations(worlds):
        perm=list(perm)
        pathgraph=nx.DiGraph()
        for i in range(0, len(worlds)):
            pathgraph.add_node(worlds[i], ind=i)
        # The transitive closure over this particular path graph
        # Simplify to nx.algorithms
        for i in range(0, len(perm)-1):
            pathgraph.add_edge(perm[i], perm[i+1])
        pathgraph=nx.algorithms.dag.transitive_closure(pathgraph)
        # Compute the graph edit distance, disabling node insertion/deletion/substition and edge substitution
        edge_cost=lambda x: 1
        unaffordable=lambda x: 10e10
        same_node=lambda x, y: x['ind']==y['ind']
        edge_matches=lambda x, y: True
        dist=nx.algorithms.similarity.graph_edit_distance(graph, pathgraph, node_match=same_node, edge_match=edge_matches, node_del_cost=unaffordable, node_ins_cost=unaffordable, edge_ins_cost=edge_cost, edge_del_cost=edge_cost)
        if dist&lt;mindist:
            result=pathgraph
            mindist=dist
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>We can then test the function, first with a graph with a known best
completion, and then with our <a href="#Example">example from above</a>.</p>

<p>The small example graph (top left) and its possible turnings are
(all others):</p>

<p><img src="./img/turning/se_comp.png" alt="A small example" title="Four graphs, side-by side. Top left is a → b, c, top right is a → b → c, a → c, bottom left is a → c → b, a → b, bottom right is c → a → b, c → b." /></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; smallworld=['a', 'b', 'c']
&gt;&gt;&gt; smallgraph=nx.DiGraph()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0, len(smallworld)):
...     smallgraph.add_node(smallworld[i], ind=i)
&gt;&gt;&gt; smallgraph.add_edges_from([('a', 'b')])
&gt;&gt;&gt; smallre=turn(smallworld, smallgraph)
&gt;&gt;&gt; smallre.nodes
NodeView(('a', 'b', 'c'))
&gt;&gt;&gt; smallre.edges
OutEdgeView([('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'c')])
</code></pre>

<p>This looks pretty much correct.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mediumworld=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
&gt;&gt;&gt; mediumgraph=nx.DiGraph()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0, len(mediumworld)):
...     mediumgraph.add_node(mediumworld[i], ind=i)
&gt;&gt;&gt; mediumgraph.add_edges_from([('a', 'b'), ('b', 'c'), ('c', 'd'), ('c', 'e'), ('e', 'f'), ('f', 'g'), ('g', 'b')])
&gt;&gt;&gt; mediumres=turn(mediumworld, mediumgraph)
&gt;&gt;&gt; mediumres.nodes
NodeView(('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'))
&gt;&gt;&gt; mediumres.edges
OutEdgeView([('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('a', 'd'), ('a', 'e'), ('a', 'f'), ('a', 'g'), ('b', 'c'), ('b', 'd'), ('b', 'e'), ('b', 'f'), ('b', 'g'), ('c', 'd'), ('c', 'e'), ('c', 'f'), ('c', 'g'), ('d', 'e'), ('d', 'f'), ('d', 'g'), ('e', 'f'), ('e', 'g'), ('f', 'g')])
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually equal to the hypothesized solution from above (below
is the non-transitive-closure version):</p>

<p><img src="./img/turning/turnubc_hyp.png" alt="A path graph." title="A path graph. Vertices again {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}. Edges are a → b → c → d → e → f → g." /></p>

<h4>Problems with This Method and its Algorithm</h4>

<p>This solution has some glaring problems.</p>

<h5>Speed (or the Lack Thereof)</h5>

<p>Some of you might have noticed that this algorithm is <em>somewhat
inefficient</em> (by which I mean <em>absolutely infeasible</em>).</p>

<p>Since we iterate through the permutations of <code>$W$</code>, the runtime is
<code>$\mathcal{O}(|W|!)$</code> (with the added "benefit" of additionally computing
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness">NP-complete</a>
graph edit distance inside of the loop, which is also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APX">APX</a>-hard to approximate).</p>

<p>Possible better approaches would involve finding the
longest subgraph that is a path graph, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree">spanning
tree</a>, perhaps the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_reduction">transitive reduction</a>
is helpful, or maybe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set">feedback arc
set</a>?</p>

<!--TODO: measure runtime, think about faster algorithms-->

<h5>Non-Unique Results</h5>

<p>Another, smaller problem is that the algorithm often doesn't have a unique
result, as seen in the small example <a href="#Resolving-Inconsistencies">above</a>.</p>

<p>We can compute the set of all possible turnings with some trivial
changes to the algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>turn_all(G≿=(W, E≿)):
    mindist=∞
    R=∅
    […]
        if dist&lt;mindist:
            R={L}
            mindist=dist
        else if dist==mindist:
            R=R∪{L}
    return R
</code></pre>

<p>and its implementation</p>

<pre><code>def turn_all(graph):
    results=set()
    […]
        if dist&lt;mindist:
            results=set([pathgraph])
            mindist=dist
        elif dist==mindist:
            results.add(pathgraph)
    return results
</code></pre>

<p>The results, with the small example, are as expected:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; turnings=list(turn_all(smallworld, smallgraph))
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(turnings)
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; turnings[0].edges
OutEdgeView([('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'c')])
&gt;&gt;&gt; turnings[1].edges
OutEdgeView([('a', 'b'), ('c', 'a'), ('c', 'b')])
&gt;&gt;&gt; turnings[2].edges
OutEdgeView([('a', 'c'), ('a', 'b'), ('c', 'b')])
</code></pre>

<p><img src="./img/turning/se_comp.png" alt="A small example" title="Four graphs, side-by side. Top left is a → b, c, top right is a → b → c, a → c, bottom left is a → c → b, a → b, bottom right is c → a → b, c → b." /></p>

<p>For the big example, after waiting a while for the solution:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; turnings=list(turn_all(mediumworld, mediumgraph))
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(turnings)
49
</code></pre>

<p>I will not list them all, but these are less than the <code>$7!=5040$</code>
possible options.</p>

<p>This brings up an interesting question: As we have more and more
elaborate inconsistent preferences over more worlds, does it
become more likely that they have a unique consistent preference
they can be turned to? Or, in other words, if we make the graphs
bigger and bigger, can we expect the fraction of inconsistent
preferences with a unique turning to grow or shrink (strictly)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function">monotonically</a>? Or
will it just oscillate around wildly?</p>

<p>More formally, if we define <code>$\mathcal{G}_n$</code> as the set of graphs
with <code>$n$</code> nodes, and <code>$\mathcal{U}_n=\{G \in \mathcal{G}_n | 1=|\text{turn_all}(G)|\}$</code>
as the set of graphs with <code>$n$</code> nodes that
have unique path graphs associated with them.</p>

<p>We can further define the set of all graphs wwith <code>$n$</code> nodes
with <code>$m$</code> turnings as
<code>$\mathcal{T}{n,m}=\{G \in \mathcal{G}_n | m=|\text{turn_all}(G)|\}$</code>
(of which <code>$\mathcal{U}_n=\mathcal{T}_{n, 1}$</code>
is just a special case).</p>

<p>We can call the size of the set of all turnings of a graph the
<strong>confusion</strong> of that graph/set of inconsistent preferences: If the
graph is already the transitive closure of a path graph, the size of
that set is (arguendo) 1: there are no other possible turnings. If the
graph contains no edges (with <code>$n$</code> nodes), the confusion is maximal with
<code>$n!$</code>, the preferences carry the minimal amount of meaning.</p>

<h6>Minimal and Maximal Number of Turnings</h6>

<p>The minimal number of turnings a graph can have is 1, with a graph-edit
distance of 0: any transitive closure of a path graph satisfies this
criterion (if your preferences are already consistent, why change them
to be more consistent?)</p>

<p>However, those graphs aren't the only graphs with exactly one turning,
consider the following graph (left) and a possible turning (right)
(with graph-edit distance 1; the changed edge is red, a nice opportunity
for some <a href="https://gwern.net/Red">rubrication</a>):</p>

<p><img src="./img/turning/counter_comp.png" alt="Image of two graphs, left has edges a→ b→ c→ d, a→ c, b→ d, d→ a, right graph is the same except d→ a is now a→ d." title="Image of two graphs, left has edges a→ b→ c→ d, a→ c, b→ d, d→ a, right graph is the same except d→ a is now a→ d." /></p>

<p>One can easily see that it has exactly one turning, and checking with
the code confirms:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; counter=nx.DiGraph()
&gt;&gt;&gt; counterworld=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

</code></pre>

<p>For a graph with <code>$n$</code> nodes the maximal number of turnings it is
upper-bounded by <code>$n!$</code>, and a sufficient condition for the graph to
have that many turnings is when the graph is the union of a set of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete digraphs</a> with
disjoint nodes. For example the graph with 4 nodes and no edges has 24
possible turnings, as does the graph with 4 nodes and two edges <code>$\{(1,2),
(2,1)\}$</code>.</p>

<p>We can prove this inductively: When considering a node-labeled graph
with <code>$n$</code> nodes and no edges, the graph edit distance to any path
graph variant of that graph is the same, because we always have to
add <code>$n-1+n-2+n-3 \dots 1=\frac{n-1+(n-1)^2}{2}$</code> edges to reach
any transitive closure of a path graph (by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression#Sum">sum of any arithmetic
progression</a>).
Let not <code>$G^{\circ}$</code> be a graph with <code>$n$</code> nodes that is solely the
union of complete digraphs with disjoint nodes. When we now pick two nodes
<code>$u$</code> and <code>$v$</code> from <code>$G^{\circ}$</code> and add the edges <code>$\{(u,v), (v,u)\}
\cup \{(v, x)|(u,x) \in E^{\circ}\} \cup \{(u, y)|(v,x) \in E^{\circ}\}\}
\cup \{(x, y)|(u,x) \in E^{\circ}, (v,y) \in E^{\circ}\}$</code> (that is,
we connect <code>$u$</code> and <code>$v$</code>, and all their neighbors) to <code>$G^{\circ}$</code>,
we have necessarily increased the graph-edit distance to any path graph
by the same amount, we have symmetrically added edge-pairs that need to
be broken in either direction.<!--TODO: make this clearer.--></p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>One can now pose several (possibly distracting) questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it matter whether we give <code>turn</code> a graph <code>$G$</code> or the transitive closure of <code>$G$</code>?</li>
<li>Is there a more efficient algorithm to compute the turning?
<ul>
<li>Can it at least be made exponential?</li>
<li>Can we exploit the fact that we're always computing the graph-edit distance to a path-graph?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As we add more options to our inconsistent preferences, do they become more likely to turn uniquely?
<ul>
<li>That is: Does it hold that <code>$\frac{|\mathcal{U}_n|}{|\mathcal{G}_n|}&lt;\frac{|\mathcal{U}_{n+1}|}{|\mathcal{G}_{n+1}|}$</code>?</li>
<li>It should be possible to check this for small cases.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Number of Turnings for <code>$\mathcal{G}_n$</code></h4>

<ul>
<li>In general, how does the size of <code>$\mathcal{U}_n$</code> develop? What about <code>$\mathcal{T}_{n,2}$</code>, or in general <code>$\mathcal{T}_{n,m}$</code>?
<ul>
<li>Does the average number of turnings for inconsistent preferences converge to a specific number?</li>
<li>That is, what is <code>$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\mathcal{G}_n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathcal{T}_{n,i}$</code>?</li>
<li>I predict <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions/208357">20% on the number monotonically increasing</a>, <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions/208358">50% on monotonically decreasing</a> and <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions/208359">30% on showing no clear pattern</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>We can check these empirically! While it would be nice to prove anything
about them, it's much nicer to investigate them computationally. This is
pretty straightforward: For increasing <code>$n$</code>, generate <code>$\mathcal{G}_n$</code>,
for every <code>$G \in \mathcal{G}_n$</code>, compute <code>$|\text{turn_all}(G)|$</code>, save
the data in a file somewhere, and do interesting things with that data.</p>

<p>In code, we first generate all directed graphs with <code>$n$</code> nodes with a
recursive function</p>

<pre><code>def all_directed_graphs(n):
    if n&lt;=0:
        return [nx.DiGraph()]
    graphs=all_directed_graphs(n-1)
    newgraphs=[]
    for g in graphs:
        g.add_node(n, ind=n)
        for tosubset in powerset(range(1, n+1)):
            for fromsubset in powerset(range(1, n)):
                gnew=g.copy()
                for element in tosubset:
                    gnew.add_edge(n, element)
                for element in fromsubset:
                    gnew.add_edge(element, n)
                newgraphs.append(gnew)
    return newgraphs
</code></pre>

<p>and start turning:</p>

<pre><code>max=16
for i in range(0,max):
    graphs=turn.all_directed_graphs(i)
    for g in graphs:
        print('{0},{1},"{2}"'.format(i, len(turn.turn_all(g)), g.edges))
</code></pre>

<p>However, my computer quickly freezes and I find out that this is a lot
of graphs:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [len(list(all_directed_graphs(i))) for i in range(0,5)]
[1, 2, 16, 512, 65536]
</code></pre>

<p>So the number directed graphs with 5 nodes would be
<code>$2^{32}=4294967296$</code>, far too many for my puny laptop. But
instead of generating them all, one can just generate a
random sample and test on that, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdős-Rényi_model">Erdős–Rényi
model</a>,
for which networkx has the helpful function
<code>generators.random_graphs.gnp_random_graph</code> (Wikipedia informs us that
"In particular, the case <code>$p=\frac{1}{2}$</code>  corresponds to the case
where all <code>$2^{\binom {n}{2}}$</code> graphs on <code>$n$</code> vertices are chosen
with equal probability."). We have to randomly add reflexive edges (not
included in the model, it seems) with probability <code>$\frac{1}{2}$</code> each,
and labels for the nodes, and then we're good to go:</p>

<pre><code>samples=256
for i in range(5,lim):
    for j in range(0,samples):
        g=nx.generators.random_graphs.gnp_random_graph(i, 0.5, directed=True)
        for n in g.nodes:
            g.add_node(n, ind=n)
            if random.random()&gt;=0.5:
                g.add_edge(n,n)
        print('{0},{1},"{2}"'.format(i, len(turn.turn_all(g)), g.edges))
</code></pre>

<p>We now run the script in the background, happily collecting data for us
(<code>python3 collect.py &gt;../../data/turnings.csv &amp;</code>), and after a nice
round of editing this text go back and try to make sense of the data,
which runs squarely counter my expectations:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pandas as pd
&gt;&gt;&gt; df=pd.read_csv('data/turnings.csv')
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.groupby(['0']).mean()
           1
0
1   1.000000
2   1.875000
3   3.941406
4   9.390289
5  20.554422
6  47.389381
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like the mean number of turnings actually increases
with the graph size! Surprising. I'm also interested in the
exact numbers: Why <em>exactly</em> 9.390289… for the graphs with 4
nodes? What is so special about that number‽ (Except it being
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitude</a>
of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_Church_of_Christ">Cathedral Church of
Christ</a>
in Lagos).</p>

<p>Looking at unique turnings turns (hehe) up further questions:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def uniqueratio(g):
...     return len(g.loc[g['1']==1])/len(g)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.groupby(['0']).apply(uniqueratio)
0
1    1.000000
2    0.125000
3    0.089844
4    0.055542
5    0.050781
6    0.016393
dtype: float64
&gt;&gt;&gt; def uniques(g):
...     return len(g.loc[g['1']==1])
&gt;&gt;&gt; df.groupby(['0']).apply(uniques)
0
1       2
2       2
3      46
4    3640
</code></pre>

<p>Very much to my surprise, searching for "2,2,46,3640" <a href="https://oeis.org/search?q=2%2C2%2C46%2C3640&amp;sort=&amp;language=english&amp;go=Search">in the
OEIS</a>
yields <em>no results</em>, even though the sequence really looks like something
that would already exist! (I think it has a specifically graph-theoretic
"feel" to it). But apparently not so, I will submit it soon.</p>

<!--TODO: find this sequence on the OEIS-->

<p>I omit the number of unique turnings for 5 and 6, for obvious reasons
(I also believe that the ratio for 6 is an outlier and should not be
counted). The number of unique resolutions for the graph with 1 node
makes sense, though: Removing the reflexive edge should count as
one edge action, but the graph only has one unique resolution:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df.loc[df['0']==1]
   0  1        []
0  1  1        []
1  1  1  [(1, 1)]
</code></pre>

<!--TODO: play around with this more-->

<h2>Encoding Inconsistencies</h2>

<p>After this concrete example of how to turn inconsistent preferences into
consistent ones, I now try to extract general principles for representing
inconsistent preferences, mainly because while the problem has been
solved for discrete cases (or so at I believe), it is still open for
preferences over lotteries.</p>

<h3>Theory</h3>

<p>It is important to distinguish the inconsistent preferences <code>$\not P$</code>
and the mathematical structure that is used to represent them, here
<code>$\not\curlyvee$</code>, since we might use different ways of representing
<code>$\not P$</code> (in the discrete case, we could try to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_function">choice
functions</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitary_relation">set-theoretical
relations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility">utility
functions</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed graph">directed
graphs</a> etc.).</p>

<p>Assuming that we have a set of axioms <code>$\mathbf{A}$</code> that describe which
preferences are consistent and which are inconsistent, for the purposes
of this text, we want to ideally find a set of mathematical structures
<code>$\not \curlyvee$</code> that can represent inconsistent preferences <code>$\not P$</code>:</p>

<ol>
<li>For every subset <code>$\mathbf{a} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{A})$</code> of the axioms, <code>$\not\curlyvee$</code> can represent a preference <code>$\not p \in \not P$</code> that violates all axioms in <code>$\mathbf{a}$</code>.</li>
<li>Very weak condition of <em>Partial Representation</em>: There exists some subset of <code>$\not P' \subseteq \not P$</code> so that for each element <code>$\not p' \in \not P'$</code> there exists a non-empty subset of elements of <code>$\not \curlyvee$</code> that represents <code>$\not p'$</code>.
<ol>
<li>Weak Condition of <em>Partial Unique Representation</em>: For each element <code>$\not p'$</code> of that subset <code>$\not P'$</code>, there exists a unique element of <code>$\not \curlyvee$</code> that represents <code>$\not p'$</code></li>
<li>Weak Condition of <em>Complete Representation</em>: For every <code>$\not p \in \not P$</code> there exists at least one element of <code>$\not \curlyvee$</code> that represents <code>$\not p$</code>.</li>
<li>Strong Condition of <em>Complete Unique Representation</em>: There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection,_injection_and_surjection">bijection</a> between <code>$\not P$</code> and <code>$\not \curlyvee$</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>has a strict subset <code>$\curlyvee \subset \not \curlyvee$</code> so that <code>$\curlyvee$</code> can represent only consistent preferences.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Discrete Case</h3>

<p>In the discrete case, the two relevant von Neumman-Morgenstern axioms
are completeness and transitivity, which use as a basic structure
set-theoretical relations. Furthermore, set-theoretical relations can
also represent the violation of both transitivity and completeness.</p>

<p>For purposes of visualization and for the use of some graph-theoretic
constructs, I chose to represent those relations as directed labeled
graphs, but since binary relations and directed labeled graphs have a
bijection between them, this shouldn't be an issue.</p>

<h4>Incompleteness</h4>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(order_theory)">Incompleteness</a>
(or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparability">incomparability</a>)
between two options <code>$w_1, w_2$</code> can be represented by not specifying
an edge between the two options, that is <code>$(w_1, w_2) \not \in E, (w_2,
w_1) \not \in E$</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./img/turning/incomplete.png" alt="Four variables, with relation a>w1>b, a>w2>b, with w1 and w2 incomparable." title="Four variables, with relation a>w1>b, a>w2>b, with w1 and w2 incomparable." /></p>

<h4>Intransitivity</h4>

<p>Strictly speaking,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation">intransitivity</a>
is already satisfied if there is a triple of worlds <code>$w_1, w_2, w_2$</code>
so that <code>$(w_1, w_2) \in E, (w_2, w_3) \in E$</code> but <code>$(w_1, w_3) \not \in
E$</code> (which is another form of incomparability). So having a cycle in the
graph doesn't necessarily entail intransitivity, unless we also demand
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisymmetric_relation">antisymmetry</a>:</p>

<p><img src="./img/turning/intransitive.png" alt="A cycle graph with nodes/edges a→ b→ c→ a." title="A cycle graph with nodes/edges a→ b→ c→ a" /></p>

<p>I assume that antisymmetry is necessary for the consistent version of the
preferences, no two options can be considered equally valuable, mainly
for the purposes of simplicity (I do not think that this changes much).</p>

<!--TODO: how does it change if they are allowed-->

<h4>Non-Encodable Inconsistencies</h4>

<p>I believe that using graphs/set theoretic relations is sufficient to be
able to represent all von Neumann-Morgenstern inconsistent preferences.</p>

<p>However, in the formalism of choice sets/choice functions (Gaertner
2009<!--TODO: link--> p. 7-9) I believe that there are some cases which
can't be represented by this formalism (because they violate expansion
consistency:</p>

<p>With option set <code>$O_1=\{a,b\}$</code> have <code>$C(O_1)=\{a\}$</code>, but with option
set <code>$O_2=\{a,b,c\}$</code> we have the choice <code>$C(O_2)=b$</code>.</p>

<p>However, my mathematical knowledge here isn't very deep, so I'd be happy
about comments.</p>

<p>(Is this true? Can't we have that generate the relation <code>$a&gt;b, b&gt;a, b&gt;c$</code>?
Maybe we'd need the choice for every subset…<!--TODO-->)</p>

<h3>Continuous Case</h3>

<p>Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory takes as a starting point the
concept of a lottery: a discrete distribution of probability on a set
of worlds <code>$W$</code> (the probabilities, naturally, sum to 1). (If we have
three worlds, e.g. <code>$W=\{\text{apple}, \text{banana}, \text{clementine}\}$</code>,
an example for a lottery would be
<code>$[0.3: \text{apple}, 0.65: \text{banana}, 0.05: \text{clementine}]$</code>).</p>

<p>The consistent case for preferences over lotteries concerns itself
with relations over those lotteries, and has four axioms, two of which
(completeness and transitivity) have already been discussed above.</p>

<p>However, finding a neat mathematical structure that can represent
violations of all four axioms turns out to be finicky.</p>

<h4>(Dis)Continuity</h4>

<p>The continuity axiom demands that for three lotteries <code>$L, M, N$</code>,
if <code>$L \preceq M \preceq N$</code>, then there exists a probability
<code>$p \in [0,1]$</code> so that <code>$p \cdot L+(1-p) \cdot N \sim M$</code>.</p>

<p>That is, shifting probabilities can move us toward indifference among
options: there are some probabilites for which we will accept high risks
or abandon possible high rewards.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>This leads to an interesting ethical consideration: is it a larger change
to a preference relation to add new information or remove information?</p>

<p>It is discussed how to incorporate those weights into an algorithm for
minimally transforming <code>$G_{\succsim}$</code> into <code>$G_{\succeq}$</code>.</p>

<h3>Ambitious Value Learning</h3>

<p>Learn human values, check if known inconsistencies are encoded (to ensure
learning at the correct level of abstraction), then make consistent.</p>

<h3>Ontological Crises</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Furthermore, there remain difficult philosophical problems. We have
made a distinction between the agent’s uncertainty about which model
is correct and the agent’s uncertainty about which state the world is
in within the model. We may wish to eliminate this distinction; we
could specify a single model, but only give utilities for some states
of the model. We would then like the agent to generalize this utility
function to the entire state space of the model.</p>

<p>If you know a mapping between objects from human to AI ontology, you
could find the mapping from the (consistent) human probability simplex
to the AI simplex?</p>

<h4>Discrete Case</h4>

<p>A node splits in two or more, or two or more nodes get merged, one adds
nodes, or removes them. If the then resulting graph isn't a path graph,
it can be turned with the method described above.</p>
