<p>When learning, one would like to progress faster, and learn things
faster. So it makes sense to search for interventions that speed up
learning (effective learning techniques), enable using knowledge
and knowledge patterns from one learned domain in a new domain if
appropriate (transfer learning), and make it easier to find further
learning-accelerating techniques (meta-learning).</p>
<h2 id="Summary_of_the_Results"><a class="hanchor" href="#Summary_of_the_Results">Summary of the Results</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>If you want to learn faster
<ol>
<li>Do <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a> when possible
<ol>
<li>In general, revisit basics of a field while you're learning</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Spend a lot of time on practice problems</li>
<li>Explain why you're doing what you're doing, while you're doing it</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If you want to solve problems
<ol>
<li>If there are already experts at the problem you're trying to solve, <a href="https://commoncog.com/accelerated-expertise/">interview them in a systematic fashion</a> to <a href="https://commoncog.com/an-easier-method-for-extracting-tacit-knowledge/">extract</a> their <a href="https://commoncog.com/the-tacit-knowledge-series/">tacit knowledge</a>.
<ol>
<li>With enough institutional support this can be turned into a training program.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If there are no experts in the domain where you're trying to solve a problem:
<ol>
<li>Search for related domains and extract existing tacit knowledge there, or learn those domains</li>
<li>Apply the <a href="#P%C3%B3lya_Method">Pólya method</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>If you think that these recommendations are kind of unsatisfying,
<a href="#My_Impression_of_the_Literature">I agree with you</a>.</p>
<h2 id="What_I_Am_Looking_For"><a class="hanchor" href="#What_I_Am_Looking_For">What I Am Looking For</a></h2>
<p>Given a broad set of skills <code>$S$</code>, I was looking for an intervention/a
set of interventions <code>$I$</code> which has the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>After applying <code>$I$</code>, an average adult can now learn skills from <code>$S$</code> is on average much faster counterfactually to not having applied <code>$I$</code></li>
<li>Applying <code>$I$</code> is easier than learning all skills <code>$S$</code></li>
<li>Optional: <code>$I$</code> is <em>relatively</em> easy to apply, that is it doesn't need a lot of institutional setup</li>
<li>Optional: <code>$I$</code> can be applied to itself, and to find better interventions <code>$I'$</code> that have the same properties as <code>$I$</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The question about transfer learning in humans isn't clearly
differentiated from the research into effective learning techniques.
Transfer learning and meta-learning are more focused on crossing the
theory-practice gap and making progress in domains where we don't yet
have detailed knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore, I tried to find more information from well-performing
institutions such as the military and large corporations, de-emphasizing
research done in universities and schools (I found this difficult because
those places tend to have more incentive to publish their techniques,
and also strive to quantify their benefits).</p>

<h3 id="Straightforward_Stuff"><a class="hanchor" href="#Straightforward_Stuff">Straightforward Stuff</a></h3>
<p>I found several studies from psychology, especially educational
psychology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wku.edu/senate/documents/improving_student_learning_dunlosky_2013.pdf">Dunlosky et al.
2017</a>
reviewed the evidence on ten proposed effective learning techniques,
and singled out two interventions as having high utility and three
interventions as having moderate utility:</p>
<ol>
<li>High utility:
<ol>
<li> <strong>Practice testing</strong>: Testing oneself on the target domain
in a low-stakes context, ideally repeatedly. Think <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced
repetition</a> with
flashcards, or preparing for exams by doing exams from previous
years. They mention that practice testing generalizes across
formats (e.g. from simple recall to short answer inference tests).
Can generate <em>far transfer</em>.
<ol>
<li> p. 30: "practice testing a subset of information
influences memory for related but untested information"</li>
</ol></li>
<li> <strong>Distributed practice</strong>: Practice that happens
spread out over a longer amount of time, instead
of cramming. This gain is also captured via <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced
repetition</a>. They do
not mention any transfer benefits here.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Moderate utility:
<ol>
<li> <strong>Elaborative interrogation</strong> and <strong>Self-explanation</strong><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:
Generating and saying<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> an explanation for why an
explicitly stated fact or concept is true. This most helps
learners who already know a lot about the target domain, and
works best if it is done <em>during</em> the learning process.
<ol>
<li><img alt="" src="./img/transfer/practice_transfer.png"/></li>
</ol></li>
<li> <strong>Interleaved practice</strong>: When learning, repeat basic
material while learning more advanced material. The
advantages over distributed practice testing seems
moderate, but (p. 38): "interleaved practice helped
students to discriminate between various kinds of
problems and to learn the appropriate formula to apply
for each one". Works better on mathematics<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Far_Transfer"><a class="hanchor" href="#Far_Transfer">"Far Transfer"</a></h3>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Far transfer occurs if one puts in a lot of effort,
e.g. after doing semester- or year-long courses on decision-making and
such. The effect sizes on general abilities tests are medium (d≈0.3).</p>
<p>Far transfer is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>improved performance at problems that are similar to but also
substantially different from ones experienced during training (e.g.,
fault diagnosis in process control to fault diagnosis in telecommunication
networks).</p>

<h3 id="Plya_Method"><a class="hanchor" href="#Plya_Method">Pólya Method</a></h3>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Evidence is not great, but one paper looks suspiciously
good. Worth investigating, especially since it's often recommended by
research mathematicians.</p>
<p>Another interesting-seeming strand of research were tests of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_To_Solve_It">Pólya method</a>. The
Pólya method is a four-step problem-solving method, with the <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf">four

<li>Devise a plan

also has a list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It#Second_principle:_Devise_a_plan">problem solving
strategies</a></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Carry out the plan</li>
<li>Look back</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_Loop">OODA
loop</a>, with the difference that
a lessened time pressure allows forming a whole plan (not just a decision)
and for reflection after carrying out the plan.</p>
<p>For some weird reason, the only scientists who have investigated the
Pólya method experimentally are Indonesian. I have no idea why.</p>

<h3 id="Judgmental_Forecasting"><a class="hanchor" href="#Judgmental_Forecasting">Judgmental Forecasting</a></h3>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: I didn't find anything on whether learned forecasting
ability transfers across domains. I now want to analyze some data to
find out whether it does.</p>
<p>The evidence from the judgmental forecasting research is confusing. On
the one hand, it's widely known that domain-level experts are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_Political_Judgment">not
very good</a>
at making predictions about their own domain, and are outcompeted by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting">superforecasters</a>
who are just generally good at predicting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the vibe given by forecasters and forecasting
researchers is similar to the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the way, there are no shortcuts. Bridge players may develop
well-calibrated judgment when it comes to bidding on tricks, but research
shows that judgment calibrated in one context transfers poorly, if at
all, to another. So if you were thinking of becoming a better political
or business forecaster by playing bridge, forget it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>—Philip E. Tetlock &amp; Dan Gardner, “Superforecasting” p. 179, 2015</em></p>
<p>I tried to find the research this paragraph is talking about by asking
in a couple of discord servers and messaging the <a href="https://forecastingresearch.org/">Forecasting Research
Institute</a>, but I didn't get any
responses that were satisfying to me.</p>
<p>I now want to analyze my <a href="./iqisa.html">own judgmental forecasting
datasets</a> to figure out how much forecasting ability
generalizes across domains.</p>

<p>After spending a dozen hours researching this area, my current impression
is that this is something that too many different fields are interested
in; among them are business people, military psychologists, education
researchers, neuroscientists, cognitive psychologists…</p>
<p>This results in a wild outgrowth of terminology: "transfer of learning",
"learning to learn", "deutero-learning", "double-loop learning", "design
thinking", "adaptive learning" &amp;c. In my research I don't think I've
encountered a paper being cited by two different papers, which suggests
there's more than a thousand papers grasping at the same question of
transfer learning.</p>

<p>This is supported by the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer-appropriate_processing">transfer-appropriate processing</a>, which puts an especially strong emphasis on the encoding and retrieval of learned information. As far as I understand, the recapitulation of basic knowledge in the context of more advanced knowledge allows for a more accurate re-encoding of the basic knowledge.
