<blockquote>
<p>New religions and mystery cults explode across the planet; much of
the Net is unusable, flattened by successive semiotic jihads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross">Charles Stross</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando">“Accelerando”</a> p. 169, 2005</em></p>
<p>Many people have noticed that they are using the internet and online
services (e.g. through apps) more than they would ideally like, in a
non-optimal manner, with effects on work productivity, reducing selective
sustained attention spans, and with a large opportunity cost.</p>
<h2 id="The_Basic_Argument"><a class="hanchor" href="#The_Basic_Argument">The Basic Argument</a></h2>
<p>The basic argument can be summarized as follows: There is an economic
incentive to get people addicted to things. Currently, information
technology appears to be the fastest advancing sector of the economy,
and is therefore the most potent way of getting people addicted.</p>
<p>If one wants to avoid falling into addictive patterns, then, it seems
advisable to be very cautious around information technology, and in
the more paranoid case, one wants to stay out of the addictive "event
horizon": the state at which it has become basically impossible to
unplug—which means that one ought to prepare to leave the internet.</p>
<h3 id="Two_Different_Growth_Modes"><a class="hanchor" href="#Two_Different_Growth_Modes">Two Different Growth Modes</a></h3>
<p>The world economy is currently growing at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product">~3% a
year</a>,
which implies that during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy">average
lifetime</a>
of a human, it grows <code>$1.03^{70} \approx 9$</code>-fold (and
that is before considering possible <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory" title="Modeling the Human Trajectory (David Roodman, 2020)">changes in the growth
mode</a>
from exponential to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_growth">hyperbolic
growth</a>).</p>
<p>While human minds are extraordinarily adaptive (surviving as
hunter-gatherers, farmers, industrial workers, scientists,
in space, etc.), they appear to have some hard-coded
characteristics that are not easily changed during a
human's lifetime (or even by evolution—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_human_evolution">counterexamples
include</a>
the evolution of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Lactase_persistence">lactase
persistence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Alcohol_dehydrogenase">alcohol
dehydrogenase</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Sickle_cell_disease">sickle cell anemia</a>).
Humanities' ability to create technology outstrips each
individual's ability to understand that technology—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore
64</a> is said to be the
last computer that can be fully understood by one person in its
totality, and AI systems are becoming so complex that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">explainable
AI</a>
and interpretability research are becoming their own fields.</p>
<p>While economic growth has been on the whole a <a href="http://lukemuehlhauser.com/three-wild-speculations-from-amateur-quantitative-macrohistory/">delightfully advantageous
process</a>,
this makes individual humans more prone to manipulation, deception,
and addiction to these kinds of processes.</p>
<h3 id="Humans_Minds_are_Full_of_Holes"><a class="hanchor" href="#Humans_Minds_are_Full_of_Holes">Humans Minds are Full of Holes</a></h3>
<p>This would be no problem if human brains were
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L4_microkernel_family">seL4</a> of
cognitive systems, but alas—we were created by evolution as <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NQgWL7tvAPgN2LTLn/spaghetti-towers">spaghetti
towers</a>,
and until we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroenhancement">change something about
that</a>, our minds will
remain unstructured heaps of pasta.</p>
<p>Not only do we bring up an impressive barrage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive
biases</a>,
but it seems likely that our brains are
designed to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820444-the-elephant-in-the-brain">deceive and hide information from
themselves</a>.
And knowing about cognitive biases and flawed thinking usually helps
little with actually mitigating them, sometimes even <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/knowing-about-biases-can-hurt-people">amplifying the
problem</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coherent, comprehensive theories of cognitive bias mitigation are lacking.</p>

<p>This applies even more strongly to addictive tendencies and emotional
outbursts.</p>
<p>At the moment, technology is just
moving more quickly than evolution or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_evolution">cultural
evolution</a> (which is why
the tricks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Pickup_artist">pickup artists</a>
continue to work: the defenses against them operate on the timescales
of cultural or genetic evolution, and the pickup artists also usually
put in more optimization work than the women they approach).<!--Maybe
this is causing the selection criteria back to hard-to-fake signals,
from social status/charisma back to height/wealth? Although it doesn't
look like it.--></p>
<p>Similarly, companies usually put in much more effort to manipulate their
customers than the customers put into defending against that manipulation.</p>
<h3 id="An_Incentive_for_Addiction"><a class="hanchor" href="#An_Incentive_for_Addiction">An Incentive for Addiction</a></h3>
<p>Producers of a good have an incentive to modify their (potential)
customers' preferences so that those customers want to consume
more of their product. Examples for this are not hard to
find, with perhaps the most striking one being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Opioid_epidemic">opioid

especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States">in the United

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine">nicotine</a>, gustatorily appealing
fast food, and the complete practice of advertising.</p>
<p>As long as companies can legally get away with it, they have an incentive
to modify the preferences of their (potential) customers as to desire more
of the product of that company.</p>

<p>Existing legislative bodies move too slowly and don't understand
the problem well enough to do much about it, and often the resulting
polarization &amp; outrage is in their interest.</p>

<h3 id="Addiction_to_Information_is_More_Dangerous"><a class="hanchor" href="#Addiction_to_Information_is_More_Dangerous">Addiction to Information is More Dangerous</a></h3>
<p>Why, then, focus on addiction to information specifically? If the whole
economy is growing faster than any human can defend, and companies have
an incentive to get me addicted, shouldn't I worry about <em>everything</em>,
and retreat into a bunker while the world around me falls into a spiral
of self-reinforcing behavioral loops?</p>
<p>Well, yes, <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/index-old.shtml" title="Disaster planning for regular folks (lcamtuf 2021)">maybe</a>!
But, barring complete independence from the rest of society, there are
reasons to focus on addictive information systems in particular.</p>
<h4 id="Information_Moves_Freely_and_Quickly"><a class="hanchor" href="#Information_Moves_Freely_and_Quickly">Information Moves Freely and Quickly</a></h4>
<p>The current setup of the internet (at least in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_firewall">western
countries</a>) allows most
types of information exchange to occur freely, without obstruction, and
nearly instantaneously from any part of the planet to any other. The same
can not be said for physical objects, making both regulation easier and
feedback loops slower. Thus, if the provider of an addictive service
is regulated in a country, it can often change servers and appear on
the web again in a short time (as shown by the difficulty of shutting
down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay">The Pirate Bay</a>,

<li>A large collection (several thousands) of books and papers I want to read</li>

sites, and different versions of the allPosts pages for the EA forum and

amenable to being downloaded this way, and I will have to experiment
with other approaches. It also sadly can't distinguish between resources

missing (if <code>-H</code> is turned on, it begins downloading the entire internet).</p>

<p>I definitely have (had?) a problem with wasting
time on the internet, barely consciously scrolling
reddit/twitter/lesswrong/4chan/…. Mercifully, I don't have exact
numbers, but I would estimate that since I started using the internet
~10 years ago, I have spent ≥~1½h a day on it unproductively, giving
me at least <code>$10*365*1.5h=5475h$</code> wasted. Had I poured half of that
into honing an existing skill, or acquiring a new one… But what is
important is to avoid wasting another 5000h, instead of crying about
the ones that had already fallen into a screen.</p>
