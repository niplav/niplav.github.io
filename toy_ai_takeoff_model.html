  <p><strong>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem">AI safety</a>,
  significant time has been spent on the question of
  the intelligence of AI systems over time, especially during
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Hard_vs._soft_takeoff">takeoff</a>.
  An underappreciated argument in the debate has been the idea that the more
  intelligent an AI system becomes, the better it can search the space of
  possible optimization algorithms. This post proposes a computational model
  of this process by creating an n-dimensional search space and then running
  a very simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing">hill-climbing</a>
  algorithm and brute-force search on that space. Possible further
  improvements to the model are suggested, and implications are discussed.</strong></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Many regard the trajectory of future AI development as
crucial<!--TODO: citation needed-->: when will AGI first be
developed? Will the development be slow, moderate, or fast (in
economic doublings, or in wallclock time)? Will one AGI system become a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(global_governance)">singleton</a>,
i.e come to dominate the whole world (individual vs. collective
takeoff)? Will AGIs FOOM<!--TODO: link-->, i.e growing unexpectedly
fast? And: will there be one or more discontinuity when AI systems
recursively self-improve? This text attempts to shine light on the last
question and highlight a (supposedly underappreciated) argument for one or
more discontinuities in AI takeoff based on a computational model of an AI
searching the space of possible optimization algorithms for stronger ones.</p>

<p>In the model, there are three possible ways of an AI improving its
intelligence:</p>

<ul>
<li>By working and investing a part of the money to buy more hardware (e.g. by a cloud provider). This should grow roughly exponentially, at a similar speed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product#Recent_growth">Gross World Product</a> (although the model does not consider wall-clock time)</li>
<li>By performing a very simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing">hill-climbing</a> algorithm in the space of possible optimization algorithms, such as rewriting parts of its source code in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly language</a> or making trivial small performance improvements</li>
<li>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute-force searching</a> the space of possible optimization algorithms, possibly in the vincinity of the current algorithm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Existing Approaches</h3>

<h2>The Argument</h2>

<p>The argument presented has the following premises:</p>

<ul>
<li>There exists a property of algorithms called “<strong>optimization power</strong>”
<ul>
<li>Optimization power describes (among other things) the ability of an algorithm to search a search space quickly and efficiently</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is a space of algorithms, and each algorithm in that space can be given a number according to its optimization power</li>
<li>The space of algorithms has certain properties
<ul>
<li>There are algorithms that have positive optimization power (&gt;0)</li>
<li>There are algorithms that have vastly more optimization power than others</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>If these premises are accepted, it is possible for some search spaces to
construct an algorithm that attempts to find the best algorithm according
to its optimization power:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with an algorithm with optimization power &gt;0</li>
<li>Let the algorithm search part of the search space for a better algorithm
<ul>
<li>If it finds one, it modifies itself to become that better algorithm</li>
<li>Else it does nothing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If it has searched the whole search space (or has proved that no
better algorithm can exist), it stops the search</li>
<li>The algorithm acquires some more resources such as computing power</li>
</ul>

<p>This can be visualized quite nicely when one imagines the search space
to be one-dimensional with arbitrary values (or perhaps its Gödel
number<!--TODO: wiki link-->)on both axes (which is of course not the
case in reality):</p>

<p><img src="./img/toy_ai_takeoff_model/search_step_2.png" alt="A jagged graph with a maximum in the middle, a vertical red line at the minimum at the left, and a small horizontal orange line on top of it, T-shaped" title="A jagged graph with a maximum in the middle, a vertical red line at the minimum at the left, and a small horizontal orange line on top of it, T-shaped" /></p>

<p>At the first step in the optimization process, the algorithm is very
weak and can only search a small portion of the space.</p>

<p><img src="./img/toy_ai_takeoff_model/search_step_4.png" alt="The same graph with the two lines, and a lighter orange vertical line on top of the darker orange one. A wider horizontal yellow line on top of the light orange line" title="The same graph with the two lines, and a lighter orange vertical line on top of the darker orange one. A wider horizontal yellow line on top of the light orange line" /></p>

<p>At the second step in the optimization process, the algorithm is slightly
better than before and already defeating a local maximum.</p>

<p><img src="./img/toy_ai_takeoff_model/search_step_6.png" alt="The same graph with the lines as before, but now an even higher light green vertical, wider dark green line on top, the whole constellation forming a “stair-like” pattern" title="The same graph with the lines as before, but now an even higher light green vertical, wider dark green line on top, the whole constellation forming a “stair-like” pattern" /></p>

<p>The algorithm is now much stronger, and exploring a sizeable fraction
of the search space.</p>

<p><img src="./img/toy_ai_takeoff_model/search_step_7.png" alt="Same image as before, with a dark-green line on top of the highest horizontal one, now reaching the global maximum" title="Same image as before, with a dark-green line on top of the highest horizontal one, now reaching the global maximum" /></p>

<p>It has now practically found the global maximum.</p>

<p>The height of the vertical bar indicates the optimization power of
the current optimization process, while the width of the vertical bar
indicates the portion of the space searched by the current algorithm.
For simplicity, the current algorithm searches in its own vincinity,
which also might be a good heuristic (since similar algorithms might
have similar properties). The width of the horizontal bar increases as
the current optimization algorithm becomes stronger and stronger, which
leads to bigger subspaces being searched and in turn better algorithms
being found.</p>

<p>However, a conceptual argument is not sufficient here. It would be
advantageous to test whether a similarly explosive effect occurs in
higher-dimensional spaces with different characteristics.</p>
