<h1>Reports</h1>

<!--What I did, why I did it, what the effects were, and whether I
recommend the thing-->

<p>Sometimes, I perform little (and not so little) informal experiments.
Although I don't collect any data during the experiment, subjective
reports on their effects might be helpful for other people. Don't take
them too seriously.</p>

<h2>Countings Smarts</h2>

<h3>What I Did</h3>

<p>When I was around 9 years old, I decided to create a counter in my head
that would increment when I saw a car of the brand <a href="">Smart</a><!--TODO:
wiki link-->. I did this for around half a year, eventually reaching
over 6000 (I don't remember the exact number anymore, what a shame).
During this time, I created some rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>I was not actively seeking out Smarts, but was looking out for them</li>
<li>Because I'd learned the positions for Smarts in the village we were living in, I created a rule that a period of one hour was necessary for double-counting the same car</li>
<li>Smarts of all varieties were valid<!--TODO: links--></li>
</ul>

<p>I remember location mattering a lot, a 2-week holiday in the US increasing
the counter by only 1 or two, and a weekend in a big european city
pushing the counter up by several hundred.</p>

<h3>Why I Did It</h3>

<p>I don't remember my reasons for starting this. Perhaps I did it because
Smarts are relatively recognizable and I was bored.</p>

<h3>Whether It Was A Good Idea</h3>

<p>I think the effects on my life were (and are) pretty neutral, though my
visual classifier for Smarts is still much better than for other cars. I
also still get a little bolt of attention when I see a Smart.</p>

<p>Also, the sportscar variant of Smarts looks kind of neat, besides the
Tesla Cybertruck my preferred aesthetic for cars.<!--TODO: links for
these--></p>

<p>If you're a bored 9 year old, this is probably not too bad.</p>
