<h1>Solutions to “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach”</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<h3>1.1</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Define in your own words: (a) intelligence, (b) artificial intelligence,
  (c) agent, (d) rationality, (e) logical reasoning</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Intelligence</h4>

<p>The word “intelligence” is mostly used to describe a property of
systems. Roughly, it refers to the ability of a system to make decisions
that result in consequences are graded high according to some metric,
as opposed to decisions that result in consequences that are graded low
according to that metric.</p>

<h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>

<p>“Artificial intelligence” refers to systems designed and implemented
by humans with the aim of these systems displaying intelligent behavior.</p>

<h4>Agent</h4>

<p>An “agent” is a part of the universe that carries out goal-directed
actions.</p>

<h4>Rationality</h4>

<p>The usage of the word “rationality” is difficult to untangle from
the usage of the word “intelligence”. For humans, “rationality”
usually refers to the ability to detect and correct cognitive errors
that hinder coming to correct conclusions about the state of the world
(epistemic rationality), as well as the ability to act on those beliefs
according to ones values (instrumental rationality). However, these
seem very related to “intelligence”, maybe only being separated by a
potentiality–intelligence being the potential, and rationality being
the ability to fulfill that potential. One could attempt to apply the
same definition to artificial intelligences, but it seems unclear how
a lawful process could be more intelligent, but is not.</p>

<h4>Logical Reasoning</h4>

<p>“Logical reasoning” refers to the act of deriving statements from
other statements according to pre-defined rules.</p>

<h3>1.3</h3>

<p>A reflex action is not intelligent, as it is not the result of a
deliberate reasoning process. According to my personal definition above
(and also the definition given in the text), it is also not rational
(since the action is not guided by a belief).</p>

<p>Common usage of the term “rational” indicates that
people would describe this reflex as a rational action. I
believe this is fine, and words are just pointers to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jMTbQj9XB5ah2maup/similarity-clusters">clusters in
thing-space</a>
anyway.</p>

<h3>1.4</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose we extend Evans’s ANALOGY program so that it can score 200
  on a standard IQ test. Would we then have a program more intelligent
  than a human? Explain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. (At least not for any useful definition of intelligence). IQ
tests as they currently exist measure a proxy for the actual ability
to perform complex tasks in the real world. For humans, geometry
puzzles correlate (and predict) well with such tests (<a href="./doc/aima_solutions/the_predictive_value_of_iq_sternberg_2001.pdf" title="The Predictive Value of IQ">Sternberg et al.
2001</a>).</p>

<p>However, this proxy breaks down once we start optimising for it (as
in the case on extending ANALOGY). We can now not predict real-world
performance on arbitrary goals given the result of the IQ test performed
on ANALOGY anymore.</p>

<h3>1.5</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The neural structure of the sea slug Aplysia has been widely studied
  (first by Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel) because it has only about 20,000
  neurons, most of them large and easily manipulated. Assuming that the
  cycle time for an Aplysia neuron is roughly the same as for a human
  neuron, how does the computational power, in terms of memory updates
  per second, compare with the high-end computer described in Figure 1.3?</p>
</blockquote>

<!--TODO: un-fuck the dimensional analysis here-->

<p>Given the cycle time of <code>$10^{-3}$</code> seconds, we can expect</p>

<div>
    $$\frac{2*10^{4} \hbox{ neurons}}{10^{-3}\frac{\hbox{s}}{\hbox{update}}}=2*10^{7} \frac{\hbox{neuron updates}}{s}$$
</div>

<p>which is seven orders of magnitude lower than a supercomputer. Aplysia
won't be proving any important theorems soon.</p>

<!--
If Aplysia has 20k neurons, then it can be expected to have

`$2*10^{4}\hbox{ neurons }*\frac{10 \hbox{ to } 10^{5} \hbox{ synapses }}{\hbox{neuron}}=2*10^{5}\hbox{ to } 2*10^{9} \hbox{ neurons}$`
-->

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<h3>2.1</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that the performance measure is concerned with just the first
  T time steps of the environment and ignores everything thereafter. Show
  that a rational agent’s action may depend not just on the state of
  the environment but also on the time step it has reached.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example: Let's say that we are in an environment with a button,
and pressing the button causes a light to go on in the next timestep.
The agent cares that the light is on (obtaining 1 util per timestep the
light is on for the first T timesteps).</p>

<p>However, pressing the button incurs a cost of ½ on the agent.</p>

<p>Then, at timestep T, the agent will not press the button, since it does
not care about the light being on at timestep T+1, and wants to avoid
the cost ½. At timesteps <code>$&lt;T$</code> it will press the button, with the light
currently being on, at timestep T it will not press the button, under
the same environmental conditions.</p>

<h3>2.3</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each of the following assertions, say whether it is true or
  false and support your answer with examples or counterexamples where
  appropriate.</p>
  
  <p>a. An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot
  be perfectly rational.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. An agent that senses only partial information about the state could
infer missing information by making deductions (logical or statistical)
about the state of the environment, coming to full knowledge of the
environment, and making perfectly rational choices using that information.</p>

<p>For example, a chess-playing agent that can't see exactly one square
could infer the piece standing on that square by observing which piece
is missing from the rest of the board.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b. There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can
  behave rationally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. In an environment in which the next reward depends on the current
state and the previous state, a simple reflex agent will get outperformed
by agents with an internal world-model.</p>

<p>An example for this is a stock-trading agent: The future prices of stocks
doesn't just depend on the current prices, but on the history of prices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>c. There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. It is the environment where the agent has no options to act.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>d. The input to an agent program is the same as the input to the
  agent function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure. Both the agent function and the agent program receive percepts,
but sometimes the agent program also needs information that is not a
percept (e.g. priors for bayesian agents). Is that counted as input,
or simply as program-specific data?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>e. Every agent function is implementable by some program/machine
  combination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. An agent function could be uncomputable
(e. g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI">AIXI</a>), and therefore not
be implementable on a real-world machine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>f. Suppose an agent selects its action uniformly at random from the
  set of possible actions. There exists a deterministic task environment
  in which this agent is rational.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, that would be the environment in which every action scores equally
well on the performance measure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g. It is possible for a given agent to be perfectly rational in two
  distinct task environments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. Given two agents <code>$A_X$</code> and <code>$A_Y$</code>, and two task environments
<code>$X$</code> (giving percepts from the set <code>$\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$</code>) and <code>$Y$</code>
(giving percepts from the set <code>$\{y_1, \dots, y_n\}$</code>), with <code>$A_X$</code> being
perfectly rational in <code>$X$</code> and <code>$A_Y$</code> being perfectly rational in <code>$Y$</code>
an agent that is perfectly rational in two distinct task environments
could be implemented using the code:</p>

<pre><code>p=percept()
if p∈X
    A_X(p)
    while p=percept()
        A_X(p)
if p∈Y
    A_Y(p)
    while p=percept()
        A_Y(p)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>h. Every agent is rational in an unobservable environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. Given an unobservable environment in which moving results in
the performance measure going up (e.g. by knocking over ugly vases),
agents that move a lot are more rational than agents that do not move.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i. A perfectly rational poker-playing agent never loses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. Given incomplete knowledge, a rational poker-playing agent can
only win in expectation.</p>

<h3>2.4</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each of the following activities, give a PEAS description of the
  task environment and characterize it in terms of the properties listed
  in Section 2.3.2</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Playing soccer.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Performance measure: <code>$goals_{own}-goals_{enemy}$</code>; environment: soccer
field; actuators: legs &amp; feet, arms &amp; hands (for goalkeeper), torso,
head; sensors: vision, hearing, tactile</p>

<p>Multi-agent, continuous, partially observable, fully known (both rules
of soccer and classical mechanics underlying the ball &amp; other players,
although fluid dynamics of air-player interaction is probably tricky),
sequential, dynamic, stochastic (in theory deterministic, but practically
stochastic, very small unobservable effects can have large consequences)</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Exploring the subsurface oceans of Titan.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Performance measure: surface explored; environment: subsurface
environments of Titan; actuators: motor with propeller, arms to grab
things, perhaps wheels; sensors: radar, vision (if the agent has inbuilt
light generation)</p>

<p>Single-agent, continuous, partially observable, partially known (in case
there's actually life there, we don't know how it behaves), sequential,
dynamic (maybe not very dynamic, but there might be currents/geothermal
vents/life), stochastic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Shopping for used AI books on the internet.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Performance measure: <code>$\frac{n_{books}}{\sum_{b \in books} p(b)}$</code> (price
per book); environment: web browser; actuators: keyboard, mouse; sensors:
vision of the screen, location of mouse, state of keys on keyboard pressed</p>

<p>Multi-agent (if bidding against others), discrete, partially observable,
fully known (unless bidding against others, since that would need model
of human psychology), sequential (money in bank account is not reset),
static (again, unless bidding against others), deterministic</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Playing a tennis match.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Performance measure: <code>$points_{own}-points_{enemy}$</code> (I think tennis
uses rounds? Maybe <code>$winrounds_{own}-winrounds_{enemy}$</code>); environment:
tennis court; actuators: arms, tennis racket, wheels/legs to move around;
sensors: vision, hearing</p>

<p>Multi-agent, continous, fully observable, fully known (though caveats
similar to soccer apply), episodic (after each round there's a reset,
right?), dynamic, stochastic (similar caveats as in soccer example)</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Practicing tennis against a wall.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Performance measure: number of balls hit; environment: place with wall;
actuators: arms, tennis racket, wheels/legs to move around; sensors:
vision, hearing</p>

<p>Single-agent, continous, fully observable, fully known (though caveats
similar to soccer apply), episodic, dynamic, stochastic (similar caveats
as in soccer example)</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Performing a high jump.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Performance measure: height of the jump; environment: a place with a
high/nonexistent ceiling; actuators: legs; sensors: tactile sensors in
feet, height sensor</p>

<p>Single-agent, continuous, fully observable (unless wind), fully known
(although, again, caveats as in soccer), episodic (unless falling over
and not being able to get up again), static, deterministic (unless wind)</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Knitting a sweater.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Performance measure: beauty, robustness and comfortableness of the
sweater; environment: a cozy sofa in the living room; actuators: needles
for knitting; sensors: tactile sensors for the needles, visual sensors
for observing the sweater</p>

<p>Single-agent, continuous, fully observable, fully known (again using
classical mechanics), sequential (unless unraveling completely &amp; starting
again is an option), static, deterministic</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Bidding on an item at an auction.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Performance measure: <code>$\frac{nitems}{\sum_{i \in items} price(item)}$</code>;
environment: bidding platform/auction house; actuators: text entering for
online/audio output for bidding; sensors: vision of the screen/auditory
in the case of the auction house, visual to observe the items presented</p>

<p>Multi-agent, discrete (money is usually discrete), fully observable,
partially known (other bidders might be human and too complex to fully
model), sequential (account balance persistent throughout auction),
dynamic, deterministic</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<h3>3.1</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explain why problem formulation must follow goal formulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The goal formulation applies first &amp; foremost to the real world. The
problem formulation, however, then translates this real-world goal into
a format that computers can deal with. Formulating the problem before
the goal has no “anchor” as to what to formalize, the goal gives
information on what to concentrate on.</p>

<h3>3.2</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your goal is to navigate a robot out of a maze. The robot starts in the
  center of the maze facing north. You can turn the robot to face north,
  east, south, or west. You can direct the robot to move forward a certain
  distance, although it will stop before hitting a wall.</p>
  
  <p>a. Formulate this problem. How large is the state space?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assumption: The maze has size <code>$n*m$</code>. Size of the state space: <code>$4*n*m$</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b. In navigating a maze, the only place we need to turn is at the
  intersection of two or more corridors. Reformulate this problem using
  this observation. How large is the state space now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let i be the number of intersections. Then there are <code>$2*((n*m)-i)+i*4$</code>
different states (2 for each non-intersection state (walking forward
or backward, and 4 for each intersection state, for each direction the
agent can go).</p>

<p>However, this does not consider dead ends or intersections where there
are only 3 valid directions. If there are <code>$i_d$</code> dead ends, <code>$i_3$</code>
intersections with 3 possible directions, and <code>$i_4$</code> intersections
with 4 possible directions, the number of possible states is instead
<code>$i_d+3*i_3+4*i_4+2*((n*m)-(i_d+i_3+i_4))$</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>c. From each point in the maze, we can move in any of the four
  directions until we reach a turning point, and this is the only action
  we need to do. Reformulate the problem using these actions. Do we need
  to keep track of the robot’s orientation now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we don't have to turn before moving, we're equivalent to an
unchanging directionless dot (only the position changes). We don't
need to keep track of the orientation anymore, since we don't have to
a specific direction before moving.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>d. In our initial description of the problem we already abstracted
  from the real world, restricting actions and removing details. List
  three such simplifications we made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only 4 different directions allowed, not being able to run into walls,
the robot will move the given distance (and not experience battery
failure/fall into a hole etc.).</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<h3>6.1</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>How many solutions are there for the map-coloring problem in Figure
  6.1? How many solutions if four colors are allowed? Two colors?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>2 colors: 0 possible solutions</li>
<li>3 colors: <code>$3*3*2=18$</code> possible solutions (TA and SA are free, and then the WA-NT-Q-NSW-V chain can only be colored with 2 different colors, which have to be alternating)</li>
<li>4 colors: <code>$4*4*(3*2*2*2*2)=768$</code> possible solutions (again, TA and SA are free, and then WA-NT-Q-NSW-V have 3 colors left, but no same color twice, which means 3 colors for the first option, and two for each successor)</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.5</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Solve the cryptarithmetic problem in Figure 6.2 by hand, using

<p>Variables: <code>$X=\{F, T, U, W, R, O, C_1, C_2, C_3\}$</code> <br />
Constraints:</p>

<div>
    $$C=\{\langle O, R \rangle: O+O \mod 10=R, \\
    \langle W, U, C_1 \rangle: W+W+C_1 \mod 10=U, \\
    \langle T, O, C_2 \rangle: T+T+C_2 \mod 10=O, \\
    \langle C_1, O \rangle: C_1=1 \hbox{ if } O+O>9 \hbox { else } 0, \\

    \langle F, C_3 \rangle: F=C_3\\
    \langle F, T, U, W, R, O \rangle: Alldiff(F, T, U, W, R, O)\}$$
</div>

<p>Domains: <code>$\{0..9\}$</code> for <code>$\{F, T, U, W, R, O\}$</code>, and <code>$\{0, 1\}$</code> for <code>$\{C_1, C_2, C_3\}$</code>.</p>

<p>Replacing the Alldiff constraint with binary constraints:</p>

<div>
    $$C := (C \backslash \{\langle F, T, U, W, R, O \rangle: Alldiff(F, T, U, W, R, O)\}) \cup \\{ \langle x_1, x_2 \rangle: x_1 \not = x_2 | x_1, x_2 \in \{ F, T, U, W, R, O \} }$$
</div>

<p>Replacing the other trinary constraints with binary ones:</p>

<p>New variables <code>$X_1, X_2 \in [10] \times \{0, 1\}$</code>.</p>

<p>We remove the constraints</p>

<div>
    $$\{\langle W, U, C_1 \rangle: W+W+C_1 \mod 10=U, \\
    \langle T, O, C_2 \rangle: T+T+C_2 \mod 10=O, \\
    \langle C_2, W, C_1 \rangle: C_2=1 \hbox{ if } W+W+C_1>9 \hbox { else } 0, \\
    \langle C_3, T, C_2 \rangle: C_3=1 \hbox{ if } T+T+C_2>9 \hbox { else } 0 \} $$
</div>

<p>and add some constraints to replace the trinary with binary constraints on
<code>$X_{1 \hbox{ to } 4}$</code>. The result looks like this:</p>

<div>
    $$ C := \{ \langle X_1, U \rangle: U=fst(X_1)+fst(X_1)+snd(X_1) \mod 10, \\
    \langle X_2, O \rangle: O=fst(X_2)+fst(X_2)+snd(X_2) \mod 10, \\

    \langle O, R \rangle: O+O \mod 10=R, \\
    \langle C_1, O \rangle: C_1=1 \hbox{ if } O+O>9 \hbox { else } 0, \\
    \langle F, C_3 \rangle: F=C_3 \} \\ \cup
    \{ \langle x_1, x_2 \rangle: x_1 \not = x_2 | x_1, x_2 \in \{ F, T, U, W, R, O \} $$

<p>(i) Would mean that a conservative is only electable if they are radical
and electable, which must not be true. (ii) is a good representation:
If someone is radical, they have to be either both conservative and
electable or not conservative and not electable.</p>

would be rational for the agent to hold for `$A \land B$`? Make up
a table like the one in Figure 13.2, and show how it supports your
argument about rationality. Then draw another version of the table where
`$P(A \lor B)=0.7$`. Explain why it is rational to have this probability,
even though the table shows one case that is a loss and three that just
break even. (*Hint*: what is Agent 1 commited to about the probability
of each of the four cases, especially the case that is a loss?)

It is rational for an agent to believe `$P(A)=0.4, P(B)=0.3$` and
`$P(A \lor B)=0.5$`, if
`$P(A \land B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \lor B)=0.4+0.3-0.5=0.2$`.

<h3>13.5</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question deals with the properties of possible worlds, defined
  on page 488 as assignments to all random variables. We will work with
  propositions that correspond to exactly one possible world because they
  pin down the assignments of all the variables. In probability theory,
  such propositions are called <strong>atomic events</strong>. For example, with Boolean
  variables <code>$X_1, X_2, X_3$</code>, the proposition <code>$x_1 \land \lnot x_2 \land \lnot x_3$</code>
  fixes the assignment of the variables,; in the language of
  propositional logic, we would say it has exactly one model.</p>
  
  <p>a. Prove, for the case of <code>$n$</code> Boolean variables, that any two distinct
  atomic events are mutually exclusive; that is, their conjunction is
  equivalent to <em>false</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let <code>$s_1, s_2$</code> be two distinct atomic events. That means there exists at
least one <code>$x_i$</code> so that <code>$x_i$</code> is part of the conjunction in <code>$s_1$</code>
and <code>$\lnot x_i$</code> is part of the conjunction in <code>$s_2$</code>.</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<div>
    $$s_1 \land s_2 = \\
    s_1(1) \land \dots \land s_1(i-1) \land x_i \land s_1(i+1) \land \dots \land s_1(n) \land s_2(1) \land \dots \land s_2(i-1) \land \lnot x_i \land s_2(i+1) \land \dots \land s_2(n)=\\
    s_1(1) \land \dots \land s_1(i-1) \land s_1(i+1) \land \dots \land s_1(n) \land s_2(1) \land \dots \land s_2(i-1) \land s_2(i+1) \land \dots \land s_2(n) \land x_i \land \lnot x_i=\\

    false$$
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>b. Prove that the disjunction of all possible atomic events is logically
  equivalent to <em>true</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For every atomic event <code>$s$</code>, there is an atomic event
<code>$s'=\lnot s=\lnot s(1) \land \dots \lnot s(n)$</code>. Then the
disjunction of all atomic events contains <code>$s \lor s' \lor \dots=True$</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>c. Prove that any proposition is logically equivalent to the disjunction
  of the atomic events that entail its truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let <code>$\mathcal{A}$</code> be the set of <code>$n$</code> assignments that make the proposition
true. Then each assignment <code>$A_i \in \mathcal{A}$</code> corresponds to exactly
one atomic event <code>$a_i$</code> (e.g. assigning true to <code>$x_1$</code>, false to <code>$x_2$</code> and
false to <code>$x_3$</code> corresponds to <code>$x_1 \land \lnot x_2 \land \lnot x_2$</code>).
The set of these atomic events exactly entails the proposition.</p>

<p>One can then simply create the conjunction of sentences
<code>$\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n} a_i$</code> that is true only if we use an assignment
that makes the proposition true.</p>

    $$P(a|H_1, H_2, T_3)=\frac{P(H_1|a)*P(H_2|a)*P(T_3|a)*P(a)}{0.1327407}=\frac{0.2*0.2*0.8*1/3}{0.1327407}=0.0803571\\
    P(b|H_1, H_2, T_3)=\frac{P(H_1|b)*P(H_2|b)*P(T_3|b)*P(b)}{0.1327407}=\frac{0.6*0.6*0.4*1/3}{0.1327407}=0.36160725384\\
    P(c|H_1, H_2, T_3)=\frac{P(H_1|c)*P(H_2|c)*P(T_3|c)*P(c)}{0.1327407}=\frac{0.8*0.8*0.2*1/3}{0.1327407}=0.32142867$$
</div>

<p>Thus, I conclude that it is most likely that coin b was pulled out of
the bag.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: the probabilities for <code>$P(coin|H_1, H_2, T_3)$</code> don't sum to
1. I'm not sure what's up with that, but it's a good indicator that I
have done something horribly wrong. Don't copy this solution.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<h3>15.13</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A professor wants to know if students are getting enough sleep. Each
  day, the professor observes whether the students sleep in class, and
  whether they have red eyes. The professor has the following domain theory:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The prior probability of getting enough sleep, with no observations, is 0.7.</li>
  <li>The probability of getting enough sleep on night t is 0.8 given
  that the student got enough sleep the previous night, and 0.3
  if not.</li>
  <li>The probability of having red eyes is 0.2 if the student got enough sleep, and 0.7 if not.</li>
  <li>The probability of sleeping in class is 0.1 if the student got enough sleep, and 0.3 if not.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Formulate this information as a dynamic Bayesian network that
  the professor could use to filter or predict from a sequence of
  observations. Then reformulate it as a hidden Markov model that has only
  a single observation variable. Give the complete probability tables for
  the model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three variables: <code>$E_t$</code> for getting enough sleep in night t,
<code>$S_t$</code> for sleeping in class on day t, and <code>$R_t$</code> for having red eyes
on day t.</p>

<h4>Ranking My Answers</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The correct answers appear after the last exercise of this chapter. From
  the point of view of decision analysis, the interesting thing is not
  how close your median guesses came to the real answers, but rather how
  often the real answer came within your 25% and 75% bounds. If it was
  about half the time, then your bounds are accurate. But if you’re like
  most people, you will be more sure of yourself than you should be, and
  fewer than half the answers will fall within the bounds. With practice,
  you can calibrate yourself to give realistic bounds, and thus be more
  useful in supplying information for decision making.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a. Lies in my given range, but I was a bit pessimistic. <br />
b. Again, I was pessimistic, but I wasn't so bad, only 300k off. <br />
c. Yeah, I didn't perform well on this one. I guess I should have been more aggressive in my estimation how early much of the US was explored. Still, 1541 is surprising (the American continent was discovered in 1492, and only 50 years later they find the Mississippi?). <br />
d. I'm proud of this one–only 7m too optimistic, for a question I know next to nothing about (I couldn't name a single thing Jimmy Carter did during his presidency). <br />
e. I roughly knew the order of magnitude for this one for today, with the major hurdle being to estimate what the state of knowledge about tree age was in 2002. <br />
f. Pretty accurate on this one, too. I corrected the number down a couple of times before checking, reflecting on dams probably not being <em>that</em> high. <br />
g. I was way too pessimistic about this one. I didn't know whether Oregon was a major agricultural state (is it?) and I didn't include the possibility that Oregon overproduces eggs. Too bad. <br />
h. Also proud of this one. 50m off of the real number (and too low! I was fearing I was being too optimistic, being exposed to Buddhism much more than other religions). Glad I did the dialectical bootstrapping here. <br />
g. I presume 1980 was just at the start of the AIDS pandemic. I was careful enough to go very low, but I suspected that AIDS started in the 70s, and shit really hit the fan in the 90s, but wasn't sure how bad exactly the 80s were. Still, 250k as an upper range was way too careful (COVID-19 killed ~200k in the US in 2020, and that was the biggest pandemic since the Spanish Flu). <br />
h. Very proud of this one. Bit too optimistic about the capabilities of the US patent office, but still in the right range.</p>

<p>Summing up: 1 below my 25th percentile estimate, 4 between the 25th
percentile and the median, 4 between the median and the 75th percentile,
and 1 above the 75th percentile. While I am not biased (at least not in
this set of answers), I am too careful (unless most people–probably
the result of doing a bunch of forecasting and being punished for
overconfidence once too often). I should have set my ranges to be
narrower.</p>

<p>Car safety was probably worse back then. The US population was probably
smaller (today it's ~310m). I think I remember something of ~20k car
deaths in the US some years ago?</p>

<h3>Ranking My Answers</h3>

<p>a. I was a bit too careful on the lower rankings (maybe I should have taken into account that being a popstar was really hard before 1880, just because the media didn't exist) <br />
b. I was quite close to the lower bound, which surprises me. I maybe estimated the orbit of Mars to be more elliptical than circular. <br />
c. My estimate is way too low. I was probably decomposing too hard here. <br />
d. Again, my estimate was too low. Probably underestimated the amount of cargo in one ship? Also, duh, Honolulu is in the middle of the Pacific, of course there's going to be a lot of cargo. <br />
e. I'm quite happy with this one. <br />
f. Ditto. <br />
g. This one was close. I shouldn't underestimate how long the history of the US is, and how early the West Coast got explored. <br />
h. My value for the number of feet per meter was probably too low. <br />
i. Just below my lower estimate. We were walking pretty slow, I should have taken that more into account. <br />
j. Again, my estimates were a bit low. I've overestimated the number of deaths in car crashes, was corrected for that, and probably overcorrected here.</p>

<p>Summing up: 1 below my 25th percentile estimate, 2 between the 25th
percentile and the median, 4 between the median and the 75th percentile,
and 3 above the 75th percentile.</p>

<p>Here, I show some bias towards underestimating the values. Maybe because
I decomposed more?</p>

  <p>Consider a student who has the choice to buy or not buy a textbook for a
  course. We’ll model this as a decision problem with one Boolean decision
  node, B, indicating whether the agent chooses to buy the book, and two
  Boolean chance nodes, M, indicating whether the student has mastered the
  material in the book, and P, indicating whether the student passes the
  course. Of course, there is also a utility node, U. A certain student,
  Sam, has an additive utility function: 0 for not buying the book and
  -\$100 for buying it; and \$2000 for passing the course and 0 for not
  passing. Sam’s conditional probability estimates are as follows:</p>
  
  <p><code>$P(p|b, m) = 0.9$</code> <br />
  <code>$P(m|b) = 0.9$</code> <br />
  <code>$P(p|b, \lnot m) = 0.5$</code> <br />
  <code>$P(m|\lnot b) = 0.7$</code> <br />
  <code>$P(p|\lnot b, m) = 0.8$</code> <br />
  <code>$P(p|\lnot b, \lnot m) = 0.3$</code></p>

<h3>17.3</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that we define the utility of a state sequence to be the
  <em>maximum</em> reward obtained in any state in the sequence. Show that this
  utility function does not result in stationary preferences between state
  sequences. Is it still possible to define a utility function on states
  such that MEU decsion making gives optimal behavior?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Preferences between state sequences are stationary iff
<code>$[s_0, s_1, \dots] \bullet [s_0', s_1', s_2', \dots] \Rightarrow [s_1, s_2, \dots] \bullet [s_1', s_2', \dots]$</code>
for a fixed <code>$\bullet \in \{\succ, \sim, \prec\}$</code> and <code>$s_0=s_0'$</code>.</p>

<p>Asumme that <code>$s_0=s_0'$</code> is the maximum of the two state
sequences <code>$S_1, S_2$</code>. Then <code>$S_1 \sim S_2.$</code> Assume that
<code>$\max(S_1(1..))&gt;\max(S_2(1..))$</code>. Then <code>$S_1(1..) \succ S_2(1..)$</code>,
even though they two sequences start with the same value. Stationarity
violated.</p>

<p>However, not all hope is lost. Given a sequence of rewards on states,
one can define the utility to be the maximum of the average of all
rewards in the sequence. This utility should be stationary.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I'm not sure what is exactly being asked in the second
part of the question. We have sequences of rewards, we have the utility
function that ranks sequences based on the maximum, and we then have an
agent that acts based on these utilities. Is my job to modify the reward
sequence so that using the maximum utility function is still optimal? Or
do I have to modify the utility function itself? In the second case,
I set the utility to be the sum of rewards (discounted, if you will).</p>
