<h1>Solutions to “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach”</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<h3>1.1</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Define in your own words: (a) intelligence, (b) artificial intelligence,
  (c) agent, (d) rationality, (e) logical reasoning</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Intelligence</h4>

<p>The word “intelligence” is mostly used to describe a property of
systems. Roughly, it refers to the ability of a system to make decisions
that result in consequences are graded high according to some metric,
as opposed to decisions that result in consequences that are graded low
according to that metric.</p>

<h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>

<p>“Artificial intelligence” refers to systems designed and implemented
by humans with the aim of these systems displaying intelligent behavior.</p>

<h4>Agent</h4>

<p>An “agent” is a part of the universe that carries out goal-directed
actions.</p>

<h4>Rationality</h4>

<p>The usage of the word “rationality” is difficult to untangle from
the usage of the word “intelligence”. For humans, “rationality”
usually refers to the ability to detect and correct cognitive errors
that hinder coming to correct conclusions about the state of the world
(epistemic rationality), as well as the ability to act on those beliefs
according to ones values (instrumental rationality). However, these
seem very related to “intelligence”, maybe only being separated by a
potentiality–intelligence being the potential, and rationality being
the ability to fulfill that potential. One could attempt to apply the
same definition to artificial intelligences, but it seems unclear how
a lawful process could be more intelligent, but is not.</p>

<h4>Logical Reasoning</h4>

<p>“Logical reasoning” refers to the act of deriving statements from
other statements according to pre-defined rules.</p>

<!--
### 1.2

> Read Turing’s original paper on AI (Turing, 1950). In the paper, he discusses several
objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for intelligence. Which objections still carry
weight? Are his refutations valid? Can you think of new objections arising from develop-
ments since he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000, a computer
will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator.
What chance do you think a computer would have today? In another 50 years?

<h3>1.3</h3>

<p>A reflex action is not intelligent, as it is not the result of a
deliberate reasoning process. According to my personal definition above
(and also the definition given in the text), it is also not rational
(since the action is not guided by a belief).</p>

<p>Common usage of the term “rational” indicates that
people would describe this reflex as a rational action. I
believe this is fine, and words are just pointers to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jMTbQj9XB5ah2maup/similarity-clusters">clusters in
thing-space</a>
anyway.</p>

<h3>1.4</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose we extend Evans’s ANALOGY program so that it can score 200
  on a standard IQ test. Would we then have a program more intelligent
  than a human? Explain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. (At least not for any useful definition of intelligence). IQ
tests as they currently exist measure a proxy for the actual ability
to perform complex tasks in the real world. For humans, geometry
puzzles correlate (and predict) well with such tests (<a href="./doc/aima_solutions/the_predictive_value_of_iq_sternberg_2001.pdf" title="The Predictive Value of IQ">Sternberg et al.
2001</a>).</p>

<p>However, this proxy breaks down once we start optimising for it (as
in the case on extending ANALOGY). We can now not predict real-world
performance on arbitrary goals given the result of the IQ test performed
on ANALOGY anymore.</p>

<h3>1.5</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The neural structure of the sea slug Aplysia has been widely studied
  (first by Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel) because it has only about 20,000
  neurons, most of them large and easily manipulated. Assuming that the
  cycle time for an Aplysia neuron is roughly the same as for a human
  neuron, how does the computational power, in terms of memory updates
  per second, compare with the high-end computer described in Figure 1.3?</p>
</blockquote>

<!--TODO: un-fuck the dimensional analysis here-->

<p>Given the cycle time of <code>$10^{-3}$</code> seconds, we can expect</p>

<div>
    $$\frac{2*10^{4} \hbox{ neurons}}{10^{-3}\frac{\hbox{s}}{\hbox{update}}}=2*10^{7} \frac{\hbox{neuron updates}}{s}$$
</div>

<p>which is seven orders of magnitude lower than a supercomputer. Aplysia
won't be proving any important theorems soon.</p>

<!--
If Aplysia has 20k neurons, then it can be expected to have

`$2*10^{4}\hbox{ neurons }*\frac{10 \hbox{ to } 10^{5} \hbox{ synapses }}{\hbox{neuron}}=2*10^{5}\hbox{ to } 2*10^{9} \hbox{ neurons}$`
