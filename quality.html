<!--TODO: maybe replace correlations with linear regressions, which give
p-values too.-->
<p>There is some received wisdom that ejaculation and masturbation
in particular decreases meditation quality: The retreats of
<a href="http://www.dhamma.org/en/">dhamma.org</a> in the tradition of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.N.Goenka">S.N. Goenka</a> forbid
any sexual activity, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoist_sexual_practices#Male_control_of_ejaculation">Taoist sexual practices recommend semen
retention</a>.
Since I track both <a href="./data.html#Meditation">my meditations</a> and
<a href="./data.html#Masturbation">masturbations</a>, I can check whether this is
observationally true. Of course results from observational data can be due
to confounders, but such results are more valuable than pure speculation,
and may point to possible experimental investigations.</p>
<p>First, I load both meditation data and masturbation data (using my
loading code from <a href="./code/experiments/load.py">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; meditations=get_meditations()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; masturbations=get_masturbations()
</code></pre>
<p>Since I only started tracking my masturbations on 2021-01-15, I have to
filter out all meditation I did before that:</p>
<pre><code>    tohu=masturbations['datetime'].min()
    meditations=meditations.loc[meditations['meditation_start']&gt;tohu]
</code></pre>
<p>And then I merge <code>meditations</code> and <code>masturbations</code> so that each meditation
is relation to the masturbation last before it:</p>
<pre><code>    meditations=meditations.sort_values('meditation_start')
    masturbations=masturbations.sort_values('datetime')
    combined=pd.merge_asof(meditations, masturbations, left_on='meditation_start', right_on='datetime', direction='backward')
    ['diff']=combined['meditation_start']-combined['datetime']
</code></pre>
<p>All hail <code>merge_asof</code>!<!--TOOO: meme with Elmo?--></p>
<p>Just to check whether the difference computed is the right one, I do a
quick sanity check:</p>
<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; combined['diff'].describe()
    count                         1462
    mean     3 days 21:46:44.564929548
    std      6 days 10:27:57.403873207
    min         0 days 00:03:45.389000
    25%         0 days 16:00:47.628250
    50%         1 days 12:27:33.874500
    75%         3 days 14:14:14.750500
    max        39 days 09:24:06.877000
    Name: diff, dtype: object
</code></pre>
<p>And now I can simply compute the correlation with time since last
masturbation and concentration &amp; mindfulness during meditation:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; combined[['mindfulness_rating', 'concentration_rating', 'diff']].corr(numeric_only=False)
                      mindfulness_rating  concentration_rating      diff
mindfulness_rating              1.000000              0.637637 -0.076037
concentration_rating            0.637637              1.000000 -0.138188
diff                           -0.076037             -0.138188  1.000000
</code></pre>
<p>As one can see, the correlation between time since last masturbation
and concentration/mindfulness are weak and contradictory, and I
weakly conclude that masturbation does not influence meditation quality
noticeably in practice regimes like mine. One might criticize my analysis
for not including periods of long abstinence from ejaculation, which
I guess is fair. So we can simply restrict the dataset to meditations
4 or more days after the last masturbation. We still have n=329, which
is appreciable.</p>
<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; combined_long=combined.loc[combined['diff']&gt;pd.Timedelta('4d')]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; combined_long['diff'].describe()
count                           553
mean     14 days 08:17:46.338198915

75%                17 days 08:22:58
max                62 days 06:34:16
Name: diff, dtype: object
    &gt;&gt;&gt; combined_long[['mindfulness_rating', 'concentration_rating', 'diff']].corr(numeric_only=False)
                      mindfulness_rating  concentration_rating      diff
mindfulness_rating              1.000000              0.619317 -0.196030
concentration_rating            0.619317              1.000000 -0.241409
diff                           -0.196030             -0.241409  1.000000
</code></pre>
<p>The correlation of ≈-0.19 of abstinence-time with mindfulness and
≈-0.24 for concentration is still not strong enough to convince me,
but perhaps points in some interesting direction.</p>
<p>Let's bucket the data into partitions of four days and plot the resulting
data:</p>
<pre><code>result = (combined[['rounded', 'mindfulness_rating', 'concentration_rating']]
      .groupby('rounded')
      .agg(['mean', 'size', 'std'])
      .dropna())

result['mindfulness_rating', 'sem'] = (
    result['mindfulness_rating']['std'] /
    np.sqrt(result['mindfulness_rating']['size'])
)
result['concentration_rating', 'sem'] = (
    result['concentration_rating']['std'] /
    np.sqrt(result['concentration_rating']['size'])
)
</code></pre>
<p>Plot together with sample sizes:</p>
<p><img alt="&quot;Three line graphs: Concentration and mindfulness (with error bars), and sample sizes, with the x-axis being days since last masturbation. Concentration values decline fairly steadily for longer periods of abstinence, while mindfulness values first slightly decline, then spike at 32 days, then decline drastically and climbing up again towards 60 days. Sample sizes fall of quickly so that they're below 100 after 12 days.&quot;" src="./img/quality/time_series.png" title="Three line graphs: Concentration and mindfulness (with error bars), and sample sizes, with the x-axis being days since last masturbation.

Sample sizes fall of quickly so that they're below 100 after 12 days."/></p>
<p>Now <em>this</em> is fairly interesting! Even just eye-balling suggests that
abstaining from masturbation might improve mindfulness up to 30 days, but
has a negative effect on concentration. That could be worth testing, so
I'd like someone to do an experiment on this (keeping a strict meditation
schedule and randomizing 4-week pairs for masturbation/abstinence),
since the sample sizes in the upper ranges are so small, especially
above 40 days where they drop below 10 datapoints per bucket.</p>
<p>But I won't do it in the forseeable future, since other experiments have
higher priority.</p>
