  <p><strong>What I might do if I magically got hold of a very large amount of
money, and couldn't spend it maximally altruistically.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>If I Were An Eccentric Trillionaire</h1>

<p>I sometimes like to engage in idle speculation. One of those speculations
is: “If someone came up to me and told me that they would give me a lot
of money, but only under the condition that I would spend most of it on
unconventional and interesting projects, and I was forbidden to give it to
Effective Altruist organizations narrowly defined, what would I do? Not
forbidding the projects from having positive consequences accidentally,
of course.”</p>

<p>The following is a result of this speculation in particular. Many of
the ideas might be of questionable ethicality; I hope it's clear I would
think a bit more about them if I were to actually put them into practice
(which I won't, since I don't have that type of money, nor am I likely
to get hold of it anytime soon).</p>

<p>Lots of these ideas aren't mine, and I have tried to attribute them
wherever I could find the source.</p>

<h2>Culture</h2>

<ul>
<li>Snowball fights: I remember having <em>a lot of</em> fun with snowball fights during breaks in school, but I haven't seen them happen anywhere outside since leaving school.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Language</h2>

<ul>
<li>Save dying languages</li>
<li>Raise children bilingual, first language Lojban</li>
<li>Philosophically Solving Language
<ul>
<li>Via Conlangs</li>
<li>We have Loglan &amp; Lojban &amp; Láadan &amp; Ithkuil, but there's never been a <em>concerted</em> efffort at this?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Art</h2>

<ul>
<li>A good series set in the SCP Universe
<ul>
<li>Spinoff series set in the antimemetics division</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hard Takeoff Movie
<ul>
<li>Humans die in the first minute, space megastructure &amp; multiverse-wide cooperation &amp; later ontokinetics shenanigans follow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Double Crux: The Podcast. Super long (>>10h) discussions between two people trying to resolve a mutual disagreement, with moderation and fact checking help</li>
<li>A Fictional Ethnography and Anthropology of Native Antarticans</li>
<li>Beautiful Geometric Objects
<ul>
<li>The platonic solids in physical form, similar to tungsten cubes, but of varying size &amp; material (from a steel icosahedron with a few centimetres vertex length to a granite cube or obsidian dodecahedron twenty metres at each side)—the stuff that would make future people say "they considered themselves a powerful culture"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Buy the movie rights to House of Leaves to make sure noone can ever make a movie out of it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Science</h2>

<ul>
<li>Better Wireheading
<ul>
<li>Achieving reversible (you can remove it and the rat feels/behaves as before) &amp; non-adaptative (no hedonic adaptation happening) &amp; non-addictive (isn't sought after when removed) &amp; safe (doesn't have any serious health consequences) &amp; ability-preserving (cognitive function isn't impaired, and ideally improved) &amp; anti-slippery (when in the state the being doesn't seek more of it) long-term pleasure centric wireheading via extensive experiments on animals, either by direct brain stimulation or novel compounds.
<ul>
<li>This one's pretty ethically questionable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Replicate the work at the <a href="https://semalab.arizona.edu/">semalab</a> that uses ultrasound brain stimulation for meditation enhancement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Breeding Superintelligent Octopuses</li>
<li>Cloning Extinct Animals
<ul>
<li>In order: Passenger Pigeons, Thylacines, Dodos, Wooly Mammoths, Neanderthals, John von Neumann…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Masturbation Research</li>
<li>Explorables for Causal Inference</li>
<li>Find drugs that cause short-term memory loss with ideally no side effects (useful for blinding in scientific studies)</li>
<li>Studying foreveraloners</li>
</ul>

<h2>Metascience</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Distillation Team
<ul>
<li>A group of people whose sole job it is to talk with smart people whose perfectionism blocks them from writing any of their ideas down and doing it for them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Meta-Analysis Team
<ul>
<li>A group of people who, whenever I have a question, do a deep dive into the topic &amp; produce a large &amp; in-depth report on the topic (ideally Gwern-style, but I would be willing to make compromises)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A roadmap to learn everything
<ul>
<li>A list of textbooks whose order is optimised for having all dependencies covered.
<ul>
<li>Plus professionally done sets of flashcards for those textbooks</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Metaphilosophy</h2>

<ul>
<li>New modes of being
<ul>
<li>What activity-shaped holes are there in our society? How can we find them?
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>At some point someone must have invented music. That was a pretty big deal! Maybe we're missing a bunch of these kinds of things and don't even notice.</li>
<li>Same for meditation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Really Out There Stuff Institute (ROTSI)
<ul>
<li>Focus on exotic decision theories, acausal trade, UDASSA, infinite ethics etc. Global priorities research on steroids.</li>
</ul></li>
