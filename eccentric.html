<p><strong>What I might do if I magically got hold of a very large amount of

<p>I sometimes like to engage in idle speculation. One of those speculations
is: "If someone came up to me and told me that they would give me a lot
of money, but only under the condition that I would spend most of it on
unconventional and interesting projects, and I was forbidden to give it to
Effective Altruist organizations narrowly defined, what would I do? Not
disallowing the projects from having positive consequences accidentally,
of course."</p>
<p>The following is a result of this speculation. Many of the ideas might
be of questionable morality; I hope it's clear I would think a bit more
about them if I were to actually put them into practice (which I won't,
since I don't have that type of money, nor am I likely to get hold of
it myself anytime soon).</p>
<p>Lots of these ideas aren't mine, and I have tried to attribute them
wherever I could find the source. If guess that if they were implemented
(not sure whether that's possible: legality &amp; all that) I'd very likely
become very unpopular in polite society. But the resulting discourse
would absolutely be worth it.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Snowball fights</strong>: I remember having <em>a lot of</em> fun with snowball
fights during breaks in school, but I haven't seen them happen anywhere
outside since leaving school. People sign up for participating in
(moderated) snowball fights, and are notified on weekends with especially
good snow. Large open grassy fields (or perhaps even stadiums) are
rented, and separated into at least 2 parts, each parts gets a large pile
of fresh snow (to minimize the chance of stones in snowballs). People are
encouraged to bring protective gear to allow for rougher fighting. If one
is to allow for physical encounters, one'd need to group by fitness/size.</li>
<li><strong>Buy a small island nation</strong>: Since other billionaires are now
<a href="https://qz.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-nauru-court-case-money-laundering-1850662899">unable</a>
or unwilling to buy a small remote island for eccentric trillionaire
purposes, this duty now falls on us. Owning an island has several
advantages, such as being able to provide shelter during some catastrophic
events and be a base for organizing other eccentric activities. Plus
points if the island owned is a nation state, as one could pass ones own
laws (within the bounds of international agreements, of course).  Let's
say we e.g. try to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauru">Nauru</a><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
Nauru's GPD is ~\$135 mio., which at a discount rate of ~5% has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value">net present value</a>
of <code>$\frac{\$135 \text{ mio.}}{0.05}=\$2.7 \text{ bio.}$</code>,
which we can round up to \$3 bio. What if we instead
try to buy Nauru from each Nauruan individually? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita#Table">average
GDP</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita#Table">per
capita</a>
of Nauru seems to be ~\$12k, but to be conservative we can round that
up to \$15k. Then the net present value (again at 5%) of each Nauruans
future income is <code>$\frac{\$15\text{k}}{0.05}=\$300\text{k}$</code>. There
are 11k Nauruans, which results in an expense of <code>$\frac{\$3 \cdot
10^5}{\text{person}} \cdot 1.1 \cdot 10^4 \text{ persons}=\$3.3 \cdot
10^9$</code>.  In both cases, the Nauruans would be giving up a significant
amount of their civil rights, and might want to find new citizenships,
to support them with this one could allocate more money so that the
sum nicely comes out to \$5bio. So it would be <em>financially</em> feasible
to do this, but would it be politically and legally feasible? I don't
know about that, and don't know of any precedent either. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium">Leopold
II.</a> privately owned
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_free_state">Congo Free State</a>,
but I don't think he <em>bought</em> it, and instead convinced the other European
states to be allowed to militarily seize it. (Our intentions are far more
benevolent (and probably weirder) than Leopold's). Nation states have
bought vast swathes of territory from others (a prominent example being
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Purchase">Alaska Purchase</a>
for $140 mio. 2021 dollars (peanuts!),
and there were attempts from the US side to also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_the_United_States_to_purchase_Greenland">buy
Greenland</a>
from Denmark—<a href="https://www.gwern.net/Greenland">ultimately
unsuccessful</a>. More examples
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_territory_purchased_by_a_sovereign_nation_from_another_sovereiign_nation">here</a>),
<em>but</em> to my best knowledge nobody has
ever acquared a country. (Yet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_and_growth_mindsets">Growth
mindset</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Personal futarchy on steroids</strong>: In <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qZXy8kGkNFyqCfHEJ/you-can-do-futarchy-yourself">You Can Do Futarchy
Yourself</a>,
<a href="https://thetetra.space">Tetraspace</a> outlines
a way of implementing a preliminary versions of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy">Futarchy</a> (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">prediction
markets</a>
to determine policies whose outcomes are <a href="https://casparoesterheld.com/2017/12/18/futarchy-implements-evidential-decision-theory/">predicted to
be</a>
optimal alongside some pre-defined metric) by submitting
conditional questions to forecasting platforms like
<a href="https://www.metaculus.com">Metaculus</a> or <a href="https://manifold.markets/">Manifold
Markets</a>.
<ul>
<li><strong>As an example</strong>, say one only cared about GDP. Then one could
submit the questions "If a Democratic candidate wins the 2024
presidential election, what will the US GDP be in 2026?" and "If
a Republican candidate wins the 2024 presidential election, what
will the US GDP be in 2026?", and, depending on the forecasts
others make, decide to vote one way or the other.<!--TODO:
link real examples that Tetraspace put up on Metaculus?-->
Online forecasting platforms are fairly reliable<!--TODO: link
track records here-->, especially for short-term political
questions<!--TODO: actually investigate this-->, so the
information would be quite valuable.</li>
<li><strong>More is possible</strong>: Another nice thing about this
proposal is that it is very scalable: The minimum viable
product can be made by a motivated individual in one
evening, but more sophisticated versions are possible. One
possible extension could look like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_advice_application">voting advice
application</a>,
similar to the German
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Agency_for_Civic_Education#Voting_advice">Wahl-O-Mat</a>
or the international <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vote_Compass">Vote
Compass</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Create markets on elections</strong>: For a given national election,
a team of political scientists would enumerate the lists of likely
outcomes of the election (either determining which coalitions
are likely, or (in single-winner elections) which parties
could win). They would also collect common &amp; clearly measurable
desired outcomes the voters might have for the election, such
as GPD, life expectancy, crime levels, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index">Human Development
Index</a>
and others. (It is possible to define more specific criteria,
such as whether certain laws would be passed, but this might
slide into already specifying beforehand which party would
come out ahead). For a specific election <code>$E$</code>, candidate
<code>$c$</code> and indicator <code>$i$</code>, a question would then be created
on a prediction platform (or, even better, market): "If <code>$c$</code>
gets elected in <code>$E$</code>, what will the value of <code>$i$</code> be at the
end of the legislative period of <code>$c$</code>?" (There are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a4jRN9nbD79PAhWTB/prediction-markets-when-do-they-work">some problems
here</a>
with the many markets that don't resolve, which we will ignore for
the time being, perhaps combinatorial prediction markets<!--TODO:
read & link here--> or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ufW5LvcwDuL6qjdBT/latent-variables-for-prediction-markets-motivation-technical">latent variable prediction
markets</a>
can help, but I don't know enough about them).</li>
<li><strong>Make a website</strong>: One would then create a website giving users
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(computing)">sliders</a>
choose which indicators <code>$i$</code> they care more or less about,
and about the desired sign of those indicators<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Using the
probability distributions over indicators from the prediction
platforms, the website would then compute the expected value
for each candidate and report the list of candidates to the
user, sorted by desirability — giving them information
about which candidates are most likely to actually succeed at
giving them the outcomes they desire, and thereby influencing
voting behavior. The whole website would be accompanied with
a short video explaining the concept, and perhaps a longer
explainer text going in detail. Voting platforms are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_advice_application#Effects_on_voting_behaviour">fairly
popular</a>,
sometimes drawing &gt;10% of the population to use them.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: The underlying software should not be very expensive
(a website, an app and a backend that could support tens to
potentially hundreds of thousands of visits a day), and could be
re-used for each election: An initial expense of ~\$5mio., with
~\$500k per ear of maintenance seems on the conservative side
for an estimate. Assuming we want to supply the elections of the
40 biggest (democratic) countries with information, there'd be
(assuming an electoral cycle of ~4 years) ~10 elections a year
— something a team of 5 political scientists (~\$100k a year
each) should be able to handle.  Assuming that for each election,
there are ~6 candidates/coalitions that cover most of the election
outcomes, and ~6 indicators we want to use to evaluate election
outcomes, subsidizing each market with \$10k comes out at
<code>$\frac{\$10k}{\text{market}} \cdot \frac{6 \text{ markets}}{\text{ candidate}} \cdot \frac{6 \text{ markets}}{\text{ indicator}} \cdot \frac{10 \text{ elections}}{\text{year}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ candidate indicator}}{\text{ election market}}=\frac{\$360k}{\text{year}}$</code>.
If the whole thing runs for 20 years, we then pay
<code>$\$5 \text{ mio.} + 20 \cdot (\$500k + \$500k + \$360k)=\$32 \text{ mio}$</code>.
This is <em>surprisingly</em> cheap, so I'll fudge upwards to $100 mio,
just in case. Still a steal, if you ask me. Just not sure whether
I'd have to fear angry politicians.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="Language"><a class="hanchor" href="#Language">Language</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save dying languages</strong>: There are ~6900 living
languages in the world, but the number of speakers for
languages is heavy-tailed: ~500 of those languages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_endangered_languages#Discussion">are nearly
extinct</a>,
likely due to very few and elderly native speakers. Extinct languages
are a loss of the cultural heritage of humankind, so just as we want to
save endangered species or artworks from their destruction, it would
be cool to save nearly extinct languages from their demise. This
is not just hypothetical: From 2013 to 2023, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_time_of_extinction#21st_century">19 languages have
died</a><!--TODO:
has rate of language death sped up? Read around to figure this out-->. To
do this, we employ linguists to learn each of the the endangered
languages and practice it. 10 linguists per language should be enough,
so we employ 5000 of them at ~\$50k a year, for 4 years, to spend
learning the language full-time, which yields us expenses of ~\$1
bio. Then say that we continue employing them part-time for 20 years
to continue practicing until we've found a way to permanently store the
languages, for example by training large language models (text and audio)
on those languages; this would give us (at \$10k salary a year) another
\$1 bio. in expenses, plus whatever cost the preservation procedure
entails.<!--TODO: invest & pay speakers from revenue--></li>
<li><strong>Raise native speakers of an engineered
conlang</strong>: Spurred on by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis</a>,
people have created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_constructed_languages#Engineered_languages">several engineered constructed
languages</a>.
Such languages attempt to introduce new paradigms to spoken languages
and aim for extreme properties along one or more axes: emotional
expressivity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1adan">Láadan</a>),
complete grammar and lack of syntactic ambiguity
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>), simplicity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">Toki
Pona</a>), expressivity and semantic
richness (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil">Ithkuil</a>)…<br/>
We know that people can use a constructed language as
their native tongue, as there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers">&gt;1k native Esperanto
speakers</a> in the
world. But I do not know of any examples of raising a child primarily on a
language engineered to exceed the bounds of natural language, the closest
being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rewmVNsmz0s">this video</a>. So
it would interesting to pay some new parents (ideally already
both speakers of the engineered language) to raise a child with
that language. The difficulty of achieving this depends on how
difficult the target language is to learn, and <a href="https://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/1082/how-many-people-speak-esperanto-compared-to-other-planned-languages">how many speakers there
are</a>:
Toki Pona should be easiest (allegedly has ~100 speakers),
followed by Lojban (hard to learn, has ~15 speakers) and Láadan
(perhaps easier to learn, but less developed and there are
negligibly many speakers (and therefore likely none willing to
raise a child)), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%93len">Kēlen</a>
would be quite difficult (since there are probably no fluent
speakers, and speakers would need to be trained) and Ithkuil
is probably impossible, as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/utopian-for-beginners">even the creator can't speak it
fluently</a>.
I don't know what price parents would put on raising one of their
children in primarily the constructed language, which might be in
the highest case several hundreds of thousands of dollars per year:
If we have two children in different families per language, and pick
Toki Pona, Láadan, Lojban and Kēlen, at $200k per parent and year,
until the child is 18 years old, we pay <code>$\$200000 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdot
18=\$28.8 \text{ mio}$</code>. We know that children can be bilingual, so the
danger of inability to communicate can basically be excluded—and since
money is not a huge issue, one could offer a ~$10 mio. insurance against
worst-case outcomes. If we assume that worst-case outcomes are possible
but unlikely<sub>5%</sub>, we pay (in expectation) <code>$4 \cdot 0.05 \cdot \$
10 \text{ mio.}=\$2\text{ mio.}$</code>, for a total of $30.8 mio.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophically solve language</strong>: Related to raising native speakers
of engineered conlangs, I am not very impressed by the degree of effort
that has gone into trying to philosophically solve language—all
work has been done by hobbyists, without a neat <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rQKstXH8ZMAdN5iqD/concentration-of-force">concentration of
force</a>.
We have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkins">John
Wilkin's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_Towards_a_Real_Character,_and_a_Philosophical_Language">unnamed

&amp; Lojban &amp;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aUI_(Constructed_language)">aUI</a>
&amp; Láadan &amp; Ithkuil, but there's never been a
<em><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rQKstXH8ZMAdN5iqD/concentration-of-force">concerted</a></em>
effort at exploring the space—we e.g. haven't yet tried to create
a language for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lullism">Lullism</a>,

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism">post-structuralism</a>
or the insights from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong">rationality
community</a>. There are
<a href="https://gwern.net/language">reasons to be skeptical</a> about the allure
of philosophically powerful languages, and it's not quite clear what
<em>exactly</em> would be looked for here, but that's all part of the problem
statement! If we employ 5 philosophers and 5 linguists at $100k/year for
10 years, we spend \$10 mio, and at worst we get some very interesting
speculation.</li>

<li><strong>Double Crux podcast</strong>: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/double-crux">Double
crux</a> is a technique
for resolving disagreements developed by the <a href="https://rationality.org">Center for Applied
Rationality</a>. In it, (usually) two interlocutors
<code>$A, B$</code> with differing opinions on a subject <code>$S$</code> have a conversation
in which they try to understand each others' beliefs and models
of the world, with the goal of finding a single statement <code>$Q$</code>
(ideally factually checkable or at least eventually resolvable) for
which it holds that <code>$A$</code> believes <code>$Q$</code> and <code>$B$</code> believes <code>$\lnot
Q$</code>, <em>and</em> if it turned out that <code>$Q$</code> then <code>$B$</code> would change their
mind on <code>$S$</code> (adopting <code>$A$</code>s position), and vice versa for <code>$A$</code>
and <code>$\lnot Q$</code>. With motivated participants, this tends to produce
debates which are more oriented towards finding the truth.  Debates on
podcasts are often unsatisfactory because participants usually have an
adversarial stance towards each other and the time is limited<!--TODO:
link examples here? Maybe that objectivist guy on Lex Fridman-->. So a
step towards a solution could be to start a new podcast using the double
crux framework. The discussions might become exceedingly long (≫10h seem
plausible, although that alone needn't retract <a href="https://medium.com/@robertwiblin/our-data-suggests-people-keep-listening-to-podcasts-even-if-theyre-very-long-483dcfc77c02">as much from viewership as

and ideally <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/05/better-debates.html">spiced

with moderation, fact checking, intermittent summarizing
of positions after a while &amp;c.  Initial attempts at this format

<a href="https://mutualunderstanding.substack.com/p/ronny-fernandez-and-quintin-pope#details">promising</a>.
This is a long shot, as it is unclear how much conversations <a href="https://tsvibt.blogspot.com/2023/07/views-on-when-agi-comes-and-on-strategy.html#things-that-might-actually-work">can be
improved</a>,
how good debate is at truth-finding<!--TODO: links for AI
safety via debate?-->, and how entertaining or interesting
this would be to listeners. Examples such as the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/n945eovrA3oDueqtq">2021 MIRI
conversations</a>
have left some participants with a
<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4Gcz3fGcYmmzhozxr/hashing-out-long-standing-disagreements-seems-low-value-to">lower opinion of trying to hash out long-standing

moderator and a fact checker as a part-time (10h per week on average
perhaps?) position, at a total cost of ~\$150k per year, fudging upwards

<li><strong>A fictional ethnography and anthropology of native Antarcticans</strong>:

from the Marquesas islands (distance:
3530km) and the Society islands (distance:
3990km). Similarly, the polynesians that settled Hawaii
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-M%C4%81ori_settlement_of_New_Zealand_theories">probably</a>)
<em>also</em> settled New Zealand. The southernmost point
of New Zealand is 2466km from the nearest point at the
Antarctic coast (the closest Antarctic point from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_island">Stewart

but if you're willing to make some hops over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snares_Islands_/_Tini_Heke">Snares

than <a href="https://www.calcmaps.com/map-distance/ryxrc5/">1295km</a>
(the one from Macquarie Island to the small island before
Antarctica). So it is not <em>inconceivable</em> that a Māori
society with more durable ships and warmer clothes could have
sailed southwards repeatedly and finally put foot on those icy
shores. (Indeed I find it pretty likely<sub>25%</sub> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ui-te-Rangoira">some
crazy guys</a> might've
done this, given the number of islands out in the Pacific that
were just discovered (?) by Polynesians sailing around.)<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Settling Antarctica</strong>: Actually <em>settling</em> Antarctica is a whole other
can of worms: The continent is by far the coldest and (as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_desert">polar
desert</a>) driest, it harbors
nearly no vegetation (except lichen &amp; moss), and away from the coasts
there are very ~no large organisms. So we'd like to know, assuming it
is possible for there to be native antarctican populations descended
from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people">Māori people</a>,
<em>how</em> such a population might manage to endure, and what their
culture and daily life might look like. Ideas: instead of using
wood (since there isn't any), maybe the native Antarcticans
could create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pykrete">pykrete</a>
variant with lichen ("likrete") or moss ("mokrete");
perhaps (with much effort?) it is possible to domesticate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_seal">fur seals</a>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_seal">leopard seals</a> seem
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_seal#Negative_interactions_with_humans">harder</a>),
and whaling might still be an option. Antarcticans would probably need to
be hunter-gatherers, but the absence of wood makes it quite hard to hunt
where the (mostly marine) animals are, similar with spears and bows—is
it conceivable to use tools made from ice and stone instead? Heating is
a big problem, as well as surviving through the winter, but Antarctica
has some accessible coal <a href="./doc/geology/gis_representation_of_coal_bearing_areas_in_antarctical_merrill_2016.pdf" title="GIS Representation of Coal-Bearing Areas in Antarctica">Merrill
2016</a>,
some of it fairly close to the coast where Māori might land. Maybe
our native population would need to overwinter in shelters
(made from ice, stone or likrete?), surviving on seal meat and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blubber">blubber</a>. It would also
be interesting to have a description of Antarctican culture: What
kind of mythology would develop in such a ruthless place? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit_religion">Inuit
mythology</a> is
already fascinating, and the very different cultural lineage from
polynesian societies would add an interesting twist).</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: With AI tools it might be surprisingly cheap to
produce such a fictional ethnography, paying an anthropologist

300 men<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> above the age of 25 who have never had a partner of sexual
intercourse (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/">/r/ForeverAlone</a>
has ~180k subscribers, so the subjects would be 1/600th of the number
of subscribers: seems doable), and randomize them into two groups:
For a ten-year period, men in the treatment group see a (paid for)
prostitute once a week for ~2 hours, men in the control group don't
(they are, however, <em>not</em> prevented from finding partners for intercourse
themselves, and are perhaps rewarded a cash price after ten years that
is large enough that they're still willing to participate in data
collection without misreporting).  Nobody is <em>forced</em> (by contract
or otherwise) to neglect finding a partner, or to sleep with the
prostitute, however participants in both groups will receive the
cash price in the end if and only if they participate in the data
collection. Data collected might be income, educational attainment,
relationship status, other sexual activity, mood (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method">experience

blood pressure and other various health indicators. Cost: \$1k per
prostitute visit at two visits per week for 150 men for 52 weeks a year
for 10 years, which comes out at \$156 mio., \$200k cash price for
participants in the treatment group &amp; \$1mio. cash price for members
of the control group at (in total) \$180mio.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>, ~\$100mio. for the
data collection (I don't have a clear idea how much more or less this
would need to be), which comes out at ~\$436mio. Should one be able to
find a similarly sized set of female participants, this doubles the cost
to ~\$872mio. Setting the experiment up to find participants who are
actually celibate and not simply interested in the money or prostitution
might pose some difficulty, but not be insurmountable.</li>
