<p><strong>What I might do if I magically got hold of a very large amount of

<p>I sometimes like to engage in idle speculation. One of those speculations
is: "If someone came up to me and told me that they would give me a lot
of money, but only under the condition that I would spend most of it on
unconventional and interesting projects, and I was forbidden to give it to
Effective Altruist organizations narrowly defined, what would I do? Not
disallowing the projects from having positive consequences accidentally,
of course."</p>
<p>The following is a result of this speculation. Many of the ideas might
be of questionable morality; I hope it's clear I would think a bit more
about them if I were to actually put them into practice (which I won't,
since I don't have that type of money, nor am I likely to get hold of
it myself anytime soon).</p>
<p>Lots of these ideas aren't mine, and I have tried to attribute them
wherever I could find the source.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Snowball fights</strong>: I remember having <em>a lot of</em> fun with snowball fights
during breaks in school, but I haven't seen them happen anywhere outside
since leaving school. People sign up for participating in (moderated)
snowball fights, and are notified on weekends with especially good snow.
Large open grassy fields are rented (e.g. a stadium), and separated
into at least 2 parts, each parts gets a large pile of fresh snow (to
minimize the chance of stones in snowballs). People are encouraged to
bring protective gear to allow for rougher fighting. If one is to allow
for physical encounters, one'd need to group by fitness/size.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Language"><a class="hanchor" href="#Language">Language</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save dying languages</strong>: There are ~6900 living
languages in the world, but the number of speakers for
languages is heavy-tailed: ~500 of those languages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_endangered_languages#Discussion">are nearly
extinct</a>,
likely due to very few and elderly native speakers. Extinct languages
are a loss of the cultural heritage of humankind, so just as we want to
save endangered species or artworks from their destruction, it would
be cool to save nearly extinct languages from their demise. This
is not just hypothetical: From 2013 to 2023, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_time_of_extinction#21st_century">19 languages have
died</a><!--TODO:
has rate of language death sped up? Read around to figure this out-->. To
do this, we employ linguists to learn each of the the endangered languages
and practice it. 10 linguists per language should be enough, so we
employ 5000 of them at ~\$50k a year, for 4 years, to spend learning the
language full-time, which yields us expenses of ~\$1bio. Then say that
we continue employing them part-time for 20 years to continue practicing
until we've found a way to permanently store the languages, for example
by training large language models (text and audio) on those languages;
this would give us (at \$10k salary a year) another \$1bio. in expenses,
plus whatever cost the preservation procedure entails.</li>
<li><strong>Raise native speakers of an engineered
conlang</strong>: Spurred on by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis</a>,
people have created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_constructed_languages#Engineered_languages">several engineered constructed
languages</a>.
Such languages attempt to introduce new paradigms to spoken languages
and aim for extreme properties along one or more axes: emotional
expressivity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1adan">Láadan</a>),
complete grammar and lack of syntactic ambiguity
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>), simplicity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona">Toki
Pona</a>), expressivity and semantic
richness (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil">Ithkuil</a>)…<br/>
We know that people can use a constructed language as
their native tongue, as there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers">&gt;1k native Esperanto
speakers</a> in the
world. But I do not know of any examples of raising a child primarily on
a language engineered to exceed the bounds of natural language<!--TODO:
link youtube video with alleged Lojban speaking to baby?-->. So it would
interesting to pay some new parents (ideally already both speakers of the
engineered language) to raise a child with that language. The difficulty
of achieving this depends on how difficult the target language is to
learn, and how many speakers there are: Toki Pona should be easiest,
followed by Lojban (hard to learn, but more speakers) and Láadan
(perhaps easier to learn, but less developed and few (no?) speakers),
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%93len">Kēlen</a> would be quite difficult
(since there are probably no fluent speakers, and speakers would
need to be trained) and Ithkuil is probably impossible, as even the
creator can't speak it fluently.<!--TODO: find out the number of Toki
Pona/Láadan/Lojban speakers--> I don't know what price parents would
put on raising one of their children in primarily the constructed
language, which might be in the highest case several hundreds of
thousands of dollars per year: If we have two children in different
families per language, and pick Toki Pona, Láadan, Lojban and Kēlen,
at $200k per parent and year, until the child is 18 years old, we pay
<code>$\$200000 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 18=\$28.8 \text{ mio}$</code>. We know that
children can be bilingual, so the danger of inability to communicate
can basically be excluded—and since money is not a huge issue, one
could offer a ~$10mio. insurance against worst-case outcomes. If we
assume that worst-case outcomes are possible but unlikely<sub>5%</sub>,
we pay (in expectation) <code>$4 \cdot 0.05 \cdot \$ 10 \text{ mio.}=\$2\text{
mio.}$</code>, for a total of $30.8 mio.</li>
