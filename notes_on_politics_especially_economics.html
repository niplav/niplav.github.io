<p><strong>After a discussion with a friend of mine, I thought it would be
useful to structure my current thoughts about politics and economics
in order to speed up my progress on that topic. Many of these points
are only rough ideas, or me collecting unrelated ideas I find good and

“alle ihre Kräfte der Zerstörung zu konzentrieren” gegen
die Staatsgewalt, zwingt sie, sich nicht die Verbesserung der

<blockquote>
<p>Subsidizing the purchase of new technologies has been a frequent
strategy of national governments in relationship to fisheries, with
results that have at times been disastrous. The effort to finance the
acquisition of a new technology presumes that local fishers will not
adopt efficient new technologies without external aid. The conservatism
of fishers in regard to the use of new technologies may reflect an
awareness that the management of complex resource systems depends on
a delicate balance between the technologies in use and the entry and
authority rules used to control access and use. If the adaptation of
new technologies is accelerated, the relationship between the rules and
technologies in use may become seriously unbalanced. This is particularly
the case when the rules have come about through long processes of trial
and error and fishers do not possess legal powers to devise new rules and
get them enforced. A focus on "production costs" alone, rather than on
the total of production costs, transaction costs, and enforcement costs,
leads to a narrow interpretation of efficiency (North 1986a,b). The
rapid introduction of a “more efficient” technology by an outside
authority can trigger the very “tragedy of the commons” that the
same public officials presume will occur if they do not regulate the
use of these fisheries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Market based decision are quite different to those made by
governments. If a firm offers a product that nobody wants, it soon
leaves business. If government enacts a bad policy, rarely is it
repealed. Instead, lip service is given to reform, and when the reform
fails, more reform is pursued. Take, for example, farm support policies,
which were enacte d to provide financial assistance to struggling farmers
during and after the Great Depression. Henry Wallace, the Secretary
of Agriculture from 1930 to 1940, argued that the farm subsidies
were, “<em>a temporary solution to deal with an emergency</em>.”² But
even though the average farm household income now exceeds that of the
average US household, and even tough there are now many fewer farmers,
farm policies persist.</p>

The whole method of analysing the way in which markets are information
processing systems is fascinating. Related: Towards a New Socialism by
Cockshott, Hayek's essay on the economic calculation problem, that one
paper that claims markets are efficient iff P=NP.</p>

<p>Regulating companies propagates down higher prices to customers, since
what you want to regulate is more ineffective than current practices
(i.e. costs more).</p>
<p>There are other reasons why regulating companies might be better (more
concentrated leverage points, more fine-grained control).</p>
<p>But there's no free lunch here, people will probably suffer because
