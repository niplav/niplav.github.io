<h1>Notes on Politics, Especially Economics</h1>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Writing this page is on hold until I have read a textbook on
economics.</p>

<h2>Before I Get to the Object-Level Stuff</h2>

<p>What can be done before talking about object-level policies.</p>

<h3>Improve Political Epistemology</h3>

<h4>Track Records</h4>

<h4>Forecasting</h4>

<h4>The Sanity Waterline</h4>

<p>Making politicians resonsible if they don't fulfill their promises.</p>

<h3>Copy What Successful Countries are Doing</h3>

<p>This is known as “getting to Denmark”, and is <em>clearly</em> not trivial.</p>

<h3>This Text Is About Doing Even Better (Maybe)</h3>

<h2>What Politics Is For</h2>

<p>Maximize aggregate preferences of humans currently living in the country
(as citizens).</p>

<p>Not (although that would be nice) The One True Good Consequentialism,
or Our Best Guess of Morality With Moral Uncertainty, since you can't
coordinate around that.</p>

<h3>This Is Not An Adequate View!</h3>

<p>I know. People don't really have stable, coherent preferences.</p>

<!--TODO: The case against economic values in the brain.-->

<p>However, it's the best model I know of.</p>

<p>How deep does this instability &amp; incoherence go?</p>

<p><a href="./doc/population_ethics_impossible/an_impossibility_theorem_for_welfarist_axiologies_arrhenius_2000.pdf" title="An Impossibility Theorem for Welfarist Axiologies">Arrhenius
2000</a>
gives one answer.</p>

<h3>Then How Do We Find These Preferences?</h3>

<p>Ask people. Maybe quadratic voting on different metrics.</p>

<h2>Caveat: Empirical Versus Theoretical Knowledge About Politics/Economics</h2>

<h3>Biases More Prevalent on the Object Level, Right?</h3>

<h3>A Lot of Empirical Knowledge About Politics Might Not Be Useful</h3>

<p>More just noise.</p>

<h3>How To Evaluate?</h3>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<h3>Economic Progress is Usually Good</h3>

<h4>How Much Do People Value Economic Progress?</h4>

<h4>How Much Would People Value Economic Progress if They Knew More?</h4>

<h4>How Good Is Economic Progress?</h4>

<p>Has been so far.</p>

<p>Although caveats with regulation/taxation/x-risk</p>

<p>Having no growth kicks people back into zero-sum dynamics</p>

<p>Disaster-preparedness is easier &amp; better (humans are risk-averse)</p>

<p>Though there's the effect of making disasters more costly <a href="https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2012/05/economic-growth-more-costly-disasters.html" title="Economic growth: more costly disasters, better prevention">Shulman
2012</a>,
and civilization more complex &amp; therefore fragile?</p>

<p>Not valuable hedonically (Easterlin paradox)
But makes paradise engineering more likely &amp; easier</p>

<h3>Markets are (at least at the Moment) Mostly Aligned</h3>

<p>Alignment of markets is >90%.</p>

<h2>Different Aspects of Libertarianism</h2>

<h3>Amount of Regulation</h3>

<h3>Amount of Taxation</h3>

<h3>Amount of Redistribution</h3>

<h3>Amount of Inequality</h3>

<h2>Four (Maybe Five) Problems With Pure Libertarianism</h2>

<h3>Externalities</h3>

<h3>Funding Public Goods</h3>

<h4>How Much Are Public Goods?</h4>

<p>E.g. is animal suffering in factory farming a public good?</p>

<h4>Okay, But What Are Public Goods Really?</h4>

<p>The definition seems kind of hard to pin down exactly.</p>

<h4>Different People Consider Different Things Public Goods</h4>

<p>Aggregate their preference vectors linearly.</p>

<p>Harsanyi's theorem!</p>

<h3>Human Manipulation and Addiction</h3>

<h3>Increasing Marginal Returns</h3>

<p>Many economists believe diminishing marginal returns, what reasons do
they have?</p>

<h3>Asymmetric Information</h3>

<h2>Three Taxes I Like, One I Dislike, And One I'm Unsure About</h2>

<h3>Taxes I Like</h3>

<h4>Harberger Taxes</h4>

<h4>Pigou Taxes</h4>

<p>Problem: Hard to compute.</p>

<h3>Inheritance Taxes</h3>

<h3>Taxes on Positional Goods</h3>

<h3>Taxes I Dislike</h3>

<h4>Exchange Taxes</h4>

<h4>Wealth Tax</h4>

<h4>Income Tax</h4>

<p>Stifling pareto improvements.</p>

<h3>Unsure</h3>

<h4>Land-Value Taxes</h4>

<h4>Capital Gains Taxes</h4>

<!--What about income taxes, progressive or flat?-->

<h2>The Problems With Regulation</h2>

<h3>Regulations Are Usually Not Tested</h3>

<h3>Regulations Are Usually Very Inflexible</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Subsidizing the purchase of new technologies has been a frequent
strategy of national governments in relationship to fisheries, with
results that have at times been disastrous. The effort to finance the
acquisition of a new technology presumes that local fishers will not
adopt efficient new technologies without external aid. The conservatism
of fishers in regard to the use of new technologies may reflect an
awareness that the management of complex resource systems depends on
a delicate balance between the technologies in use and the entry and
authority rules used to control access and use. If the adaptation of
new technologies is accelerated, the relationship between the rules and
technologies in use may become seriously unbalanced. This is particularly
the case when the rules have come about through long processes of trial
and error and fishers do not possess legal powers to devise new rules and
get them enforced. A focus on "production costs" alone, rather than on
the total of production costs, transaction costs, and enforcement costs,
leads to a narrow interpretation of efficiency (North 1986a,b). The
rapid introduction of a “more efficient” technology by an outside
authority can trigger the very “tragedy of the commons” that the
same public officials presume will occur if they do not regulate the
use of these fisheries.</p>
</blockquote>

Columbia from the Cryonics Wikipedia page-->

<h3>Regulations Are Usually Not Retracted</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Market based decision are quite different to those made by
governments. If a firm offers a product that nobody wants, it soon
leaves business. If government enacts a bad policy, rarely is it
repealed. Instead, lip service is given to reform, and when the reform
fails, more reform is pursued. Take, for example, farm support policies,
which were enacte d to provide financial assistance to struggling farmers
during and after the Great Depression. Henry Wallace, the Secretary
of Agriculture from 1930 to 1940, argued that the farm subsidies
were, “<em>a temporary solution to deal with an emergency</em>.”² But
even though the average farm household income now exceeds that of the
average US household, and even tough there are now many fewer farmers,
farm policies persist.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Prediction Markets</h4>

<h4>Nuclear Power</h4>

<h3>Tax Rather Than Regulate</h3>

<p><a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/" title="A Something Sort of Like Left-Libertarianism-Ist Manifesto">Alexander 2013</a></p>

<h2>How Much To Redistribute is an Empirical Question</h2>

<p>Heuristic against: Disincentivizes production, since more redistribution
makes production more like a public good, and public goods are hard
to fund.</p>

<p>Heuristic against: People <em>do</em> seem motivated by large amounts of money.</p>

<p>Heuristic in favour: There are strong social incentives for people to
want to work.</p>

<p>Heuristic in favour: Shlegeris says so.</p>

<h2>Some Low-key Utopias</h2>

<h3>A-Btopia</h3>

<p>Test your damn laws.</p>

<h4>Why Is There So Little Large-Scale Testing?</h4>

<h3>Decaytopia</h3>

<p>At least the regulation is not forever.</p>

<h3>Scaletopia</h3>

<p>Strength of regulation scales with organisational size. (Is this
actually good?)</p>

<h3>Futarchy</h3>

<p>Spectrum from "Politicians sometimes look at prediction markets" to
"What do you mean by “politicians”? We quadratically vote our values,
then the markets optimize for us"/Raikoth.</p>

<h4>Problems With Futarchy</h4>

<h5>Correlation of Payout-Currency and Policies</h5>

<p>Possible solution: create a stable independent currency (maybe with
crypto, isn't there a Wei currency that tries to achieve this?)</p>

<h5>Goodharts Law</h5>

<p>Mild optimization by reducing size/funding for prediction markets.</p>

<p>Resulting problem: this makes manipulation easier.</p>

<h5>Reward Hacking</h5>

<p>Don't know how to approach this one, maybe secret cabal of data
collectors? Data collectors are not allowed to trade?</p>

<h5>Turns into Assassination Market</h5>

<h4>Approval-Directed Futarchy?</h4>

<!--Rename, approval-directed would imply that government is transparent
– which is also perhaps a good idea-->

<p>Select n random people (something like 10k, or 0.01% of the population),
ask them how much they approve of the governing in the last year (or
whatever timespan the prediction markets operate on). Try to optimize
that measure.</p>

<h2>Miscellania</h2>

<h3>Democracy</h3>

<h4>Democracy Is Good For One Thing We Don't Really Use It For</h4>

<p>Discovering values, not policies.</p>

<h4>Modern Democracies Are Highly Indirect For A Reason</h4>

<h4>Voting Is Participating In A Public Good</h4>

<h3>Inequality</h3>

<h4>Inequality Might be About Grabbing</h4>

<h4>Why So Specific Inequality?</h4>

<h3>Most Complaints About Capitalism are Complaints About Other People Not Caring</h3>

<h3>Unions Seem Good</h3>

<p>Use the same cartel laws for unions as for companies. Also the current
implementation for unions is really weird.</p>

<h3>Regulate/Tax Companies Proportional to Size</h3>

<h3>Nate Soares Should Release His Notes on this Topic</h3>

<h3>Some Infuriating Arguments Related to Economics</h3>

<h4>“If We Fix Climate-Change and it Wasn't A Concern, We Will Have Lost Nothing”</h4>

<p>Opportunity cost, huge: around $100b per year.</p>

<p>This is not to say that I believe climate change to be harmless,
I don't, and currently believe the recommendations in <a href="https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-1-review-of-basics/" title="Climate technology primer (1/3): basics">Marblestone
2019a</a>,
<a href="https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-2-co2-removal/" title="Climate technology primer (1/3): basics">Marblestone
2019b</a>
and <a href="https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-3-other-interventions/" title="Climate technology primer (3/3): other interventions">Marblestone
2019c</a>
to be reasonable (although geoengineering seems quite dangerous, and
should probably only be used as a last measure, if at all).</p>

<h4>“We Should Regulate Companies Rather Than Encouraging Individual Actions”</h4>

<p>Regulating companies propagates down higher prices to customers, since
what you want to regulate is more ineffective than current practices
(i.e. costs more).</p>

<p>There are other reasons why regulating companies might be better (more
concentrated leverage points, more fine-grained control).</p>

<p>But there's no free lunch here, people will probably suffer because
of this.</p>
