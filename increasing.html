argues that we should reduce sleep need, pointing out that these ~30%
of our lives might be better spent on other activities, be they conscious
leisure or work.</p>
<p>Beliefs are for action, all statistics is decision theory. In choosing
how (much) to sleep, and in what way, we want to trade off benefits
against costs. The benefit of sleeping less is quite straightforward:
More time spent awake, either in leisure or working, making more use of
the limited amount of time we have before dying.</p>
<p>The costs are more subtle: Some intervention we're considering might have
negative side effects, either only on the hours gained or on all of the
hours spent awake, or having an effect on expected lifespan.  So we have
to decide how much we (e.g.) (dis)value spending an additional hour awake,
but being 5% more dizzy during those 17 waking hours.</p>

<p>My rule of thumb is melatonin subtracts an hour [of sleep
time]. (I originally guessed at this value, but my Zeo
sleep recordings seem to suggest the value is <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Zeo.html#melatonin-analysis">more like 50
minutes</a>.) That is:
if one slept for 7 hours, one awakes as refreshed as if one had slept
for 8 hours etc. From comparing with others, I think I benefit more than
around two-thirds of people.</p>

<p>While it may be true that, when doing intensive practice, the need
for sleep may go down to perhaps four to six hour or less at a time,
try to get at least some sleep every night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>—Daniel Ingram, “Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha”, p. 179</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meditation in dreams and lucid dreaming is common in this territory
[of the Arising and Passing away]. The need for sleep may be greatly
reduced. […] The big difference between the A&amp;P and Equanimity is that this
stage is generally ruled by quick cycles, quickly changing frequencies
of vibrations, odd physical movements, strange breathing patterns, heady
raptures, a decreased need for sleep, strong bliss, and a general sense
of riding on a spiritual roller coaster with no brakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>—Daniel Ingram, “Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha”, p. 275</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Need for sleep tends to increase in the Three Characteristics, mostly
due to how tiring pain can be. Sleep need can drop dramatically in the
stage of the A&amp;P, suddenly peak in dissolution, drop a bit again in Fear
as our energy returns, and increase during the Dark Night, mostly due
to how mentally fatiguing that stage can be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>—Daniel Ingram, “Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha”, p. 379</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interesting thing is that all four of these people within a year
or so of having started this practice claimed to have done it, and by
“it” I mean eliminated all emotions entirely, replacing them with a
perpetually wonderful perception of the freshness of the sensate world,
a lack of time pressure, a reduced need for sleep, and some other benefits
and odd side effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>—Daniel Ingram, “Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha”, p. 462</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sleep models generally relate to either sleeping less or being
awake in some way while asleep. Sleeping less is common during retreats,
particularly in some stages such as the A&amp;P. I also know some people who,
because of spiritual attainments, have reduced their need for sleep,
and this has happened to me at points, but it hasn't been sustained in
my case.</p>

find that long-term meditators sleep ~2.5h less at 2.3h meditation/day,
which suggests that one can reap the benefits of meditation while also
increasing the time spent lucid, if one values time in meditation half
as much as other waking time at $2.5/hr. This gives a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Present_Value">net present
value</a> over the next
40 years of</p>
<p><code>$\sum_{i=0}^{40} \frac{365 \cdot \$5/\text{hr} \cdot 2 \text{hr} \cdot 0.5}{1.05^i}=\$33140$</code>.</p>
<p>The quality of the evidence here is very slim, but anecdotes<!--TODO:
link, maybe MCTB?--> point towards sleep durations decreasing during
meditation retreats. It would be quite interesting to know the relation
between time spent meditating and amount of time slept.</p>
