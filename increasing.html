<p><a href="https://harsimony.wordpress.com/2021/02/05/why-sleep/">Harsimony 2021</a>
argues that we should reduce sleep need, pointing out that these ~30%
of our lives might be better spent on other activities, be they conscious
leisure or work.</p>
<p>Beliefs are for action, all statistics is decision theory. In choosing
how (much) to sleep, and in what way, we want to trade off benefits
against costs. The benefit of sleeping less is quite straightforward:
More time spent awake, either in leisure or working, making more use of
the limited amount of time we have before dying.</p>
<p>The costs are more subtle: Some intervention we're considering might have
negative side effects, either only on the hours gained or on all of the
hours spent awake, or having an effect on expected lifespan.  So we have
to decide how much we (e.g.) (dis)value spending an additional hour awake,
but being 5% more dizzy during those 17 waking hours. Ideal interventions
would just reduce sleep duration, while not impacting (or even improving)
cognitive function, mood and physical appearance during waking hours.</p>

<!--TODO: incorporate info from two meta-analyses linked in twitter replies-->
<!--Question: *Why does melatonin show reduced sleep duration in internet
hobbyist studies, but professional meta-analyses show slight increase
in duration? Is it the overdosing of melatonin in nearly all settings?-->
<p><a href="https://www.gwern.net/Melatonin#tempus-fugit">Gwern 2019</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My rule of thumb is melatonin subtracts an hour. (I
originally guessed at this value, but my Zeo sleep
recordings seem to suggest the value is <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Zeo.html#melatonin-analysis">more like 50
minutes</a>.) That is:
if one slept for 7 hours, one awakes as refreshed as if one had slept
for 8 hours etc. From comparing with others, I think I benefit more than
around two-thirds of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="./nootropics.html#Reducing_Sleep_Duration">analyze</a> my own data,
and (weakly) conclude that melatonin reduces my sleep duration by ~25
minutes, although I have not checked whether melatonin simply makes my
body go into sleep debt which is then paid off the next night.</p>
<p>But a meta-analysis I've found claim that melatonin increases sleep
duration by ~13 minutes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Melatonin treatment significantly […] increased total sleep duration
by 12.8 min (95% CI 2.9, 22.8). […]<br/>
Since 15 of the 17 studies enrolled healthy subjects or people with no
relevant medical condition other than insomnia, the analysis was also
done including only these 15 studies. […] sleep duration increased to
13.7 min (95% CI (3.1, 24.3)).</p>

<p>What's going on here? It might be that the studies were done on insomniacs
and not healthy people who want to decrease their sleep duration, or it
might be that the dose was too high (i.e. &gt;1mg), and thus increased sleep
duration. The first one is unlikely: The studies with the highest amount
of sleep increase (Attenburrow (96) and Hughes (97)) were both on healthy
individuals, and the two studies which showed a noticeable decrease in
sleep duration were both on insomniacs (Dahlitz (91) and Shamir (00)
(which was on <em>schizophrenic</em> insomniacs). The dose being too high seems
more plausible, but I don't understand how they dealt with different
doses (or whether they treated all doses as equal). Dahlitz (91) gave
5mg of melatonin, Shamir (00) 2mg, while Attenburrow (96) and Hughes
(97) gave mixed doses from 0.3mg to 1mg and 1mg to 40mg (!), respectively.</p>
<p>I don't know what to conclude from this, except that it seems like I
should run a self-blinded RCT on melatonin.</p>

<p>Meditation in dreams and lucid dreaming is common in this territory
[of the Arising and Passing away]. The need for sleep may be greatly
reduced. […] The big difference between the A&amp;P and Equanimity is that this
stage is generally ruled by quick cycles, quickly changing frequencies
of vibrations, odd physical movements, strange breathing patterns, heady
raptures, a decreased need for sleep, strong bliss, and a general sense
of riding on a spiritual roller coaster with no brakes.</p>

<p>Need for sleep tends to increase in the Three Characteristics, mostly
due to how tiring pain can be. Sleep need can drop dramatically in the
stage of the A&amp;P, suddenly peak in dissolution, drop a bit again in Fear
as our energy returns, and increase during the Dark Night, mostly due
to how mentally fatiguing that stage can be.</p>

<p><em>—Daniel Ingram, “Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha”, p. 462</em></p>

<p>The sleep models generally relate to either sleeping less or being
awake in some way while asleep. Sleeping less is common during retreats,

<p>most popular polyphasic sleep schedules (as described below)[…]
will result in less sleep obtained because of the influence of circadian
rhythmicity on sleep, and may disproportionately deprive individuals of
REM sleep.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Proponents claim that for the most optimal (“Uberman”), polyphasic
sleep schedule, adherants should strive to achieve six 20-minute sleep
episodes spaced evenly across the 24-hour day for a total targeted sleep
duration of 2 hours per 24 hours.⁵ Those who are unable to attain this
goal are urged to adopt the Everyman polyphasic sleep schedule, which
incorporates a 3-hour nighttime core sleep with three 20-minute daytime
sleep episodes, designed to achieve a total targeted sleep duration of
4 hours per 24 hours. Another example is the Triphasic sleep schedule:
sleep episodes after dusk, before dawn, and in the afternoon for a total
of 4-5 h per 24 hours.</p>

<p>While we don't have data on life expectancy, we can make statements
about the amount of life expectancy that would need to be <em>lost</em> to
render polyphasic sleep equivalent in value to normal sleep.</p>
<p>Take for example the triphasic schedule. It results in being awake 19.5
hours a day, instead of only 16, which is ~21.9% longer. Assuming the
reader is currently 30 years old and will keep this polyphasic schedule
to the age of 70, this is then equivalent to 50.8k hours, or
<code>$(1270 \cdot 40)/(365 \cdot 24)=5.8$</code> additional years of life (or 8.7
years of life if we only count the waking hours).</p>
<p>Another perspective is the break-even point in terms of quality of the
waking hours: How much <em>worse</em> do my waking hours need to be due to the
polyphasic sleep schedule in order to not pursue polyphasic sleep?  Taking
the triphasic schedule again, this number would be <code>$1-(16/19.5)≈0.18$</code>:
If an hour on a triphasic schedule were, say, 20% less valuable, a day
of 19.5 waking hours would have a value equivalent to
<code>$19.5h \cdot (1-0.2)≈15.6h$</code> fully rested waking hours.</p>
<p>My intuition, from sleep deprived days, is that the quality-decrease for
sleep deprived hours is far higher than a 25% reduction, which rules
out polyphasic sleep. However, I haven't attempted to live on such a
schedule for a prolonged time, so I might be mistaken.</p>
<!--
##### Does Polyphasic Sleep Have Any Advantage over Sleeping Less?

Hartly 1974 suggests yes: 4h continuous sleep is generally worse than 3× 80 minutes sleep, but both worse than 8h continuous
Bonnet & Arand 1995 suggest the effects are similar, 4h continuous vs. 4×1h

<h3 id="Frustrations"><a class="hanchor" href="#Frustrations">Frustrations</a></h3>
<p>Here's a thing about sleep research: The Sleep Research Mafia has decided
that no good thing can ever decrease sleep duration. Decreasing sleep
duration is <em>bad</em>, it's <strong>Lucifer</strong>, it is the <strong><em>primordial evil</em></strong>
plaguing this world. This is, of course, never said, but you can feel
it pouring out of every page: People trying to decrease their sleep need
with e.g. polyphasic sleep are subtly sneered at, every good thing gets
reported as increasing sleep duration, and every bad thing gets reported
as decreasing sleep duration (almost surely through the magic of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-drawer_effect">file-drawer effect</a>).
No wonder nobody has yet done an Orexin-A trial! They're fundamentally
uninterested about reducing the time spent asleep.</p>
<p>I don't trust this fucking field to honestly report on things they find
to robustly decrease sleep need. My best hope is that there's some things
that so reliably decrease sleep need that they're impossible to ignore.</p>

<p>Sleep can be made more lucid in three different ways: Either by increasing
the number of dreams experienced, or by increasing the subjective duration
of each dream, or by making existing dreams more lucid (i.e. increasing
the "amount of consciousness" present in each dream, so that the dream
isn't just a haze over unawareness, but vivid and impressive).</p>
