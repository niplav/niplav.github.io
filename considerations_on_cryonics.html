<p>Many would-be cryonicists cryocrastinate, i.e. they put off signing
up for cryonics until a later point in their life. This has often
been explained by the fact that signing up for cryonics <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hiDkhLyN5S2MEjrSE/normal-cryonics" title="Normal Cryonics">requires high
conscientiousness</a>
and can be easily be delayed until another point in life.</p>

<p>I'll get around to doing it eventually</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>— person who was cremated</em></p>
<p>However, it hasn't yet been explored whether this procrastination might be
rational if eventually followed through with: Many cryonics organisations
have high membership fees, which might be avoided by waiting.</p>
<p>To find this out, I first present a point-estimate model of
whether (and if yes, when) to sign up for cryonics. The model is
written in <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>. I then proceed and create a
<a href="https://www.getguesstimate.com/">Guesstimate</a> model to determine the
distribution of the expected value of signing up.</p>

<p>This cost-benefit calculation depends on various factors that carry
significant uncertainty with them, and necessarily contains numerous
simplifications and inadequacies. The calculated values ought to be
equipped with gigantic error bars. I encourage others to make their
own calculations and models, compare results and bet on the relevant
probabilities.</p>
<p>Specifically, this analysis attempts to be relatively
conservative, think of the lower range of a 50% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence
interval</a>. For example,
this leads to excluding singularity scenarios with lifespans of billions
or trillions of years at enormous quality. This is a balancing act,
some people might criticize that the number of worlds with indefinite
life extension and cryonics revival but without cosmic endowment is
very small. These concerns might be correct, but bare resemblance to
<a href="ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_mugging">Pascal's mugging</a>-like
scenarios. In order to avoid such concerns, I focus on <em>relatively</em>
unspectacular visions of the future. If cosmic-endowment scenarios are
more likely than I suspect, this only strengthens the case for signing up.</p>

<p>To find out whether to sign up for cryonics at all, one needs
to make a cost-benefit calculation. This has been <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/break-cryonics-down.html" title="Break Cryonics Down">attempted
before</a>,
but that analysis has been rather short
(disregarding several important factors) and it might be productive to
approach the topic independently.</p>
<p>The costs of cryonics are comparatively easy to calculate and contain
little uncertainty: The price of cryopreservation and life-insurance
are widely known, and can be easily added together. The benefits of
cryopreservation, however, contain a lot more uncertainty: It is not at
all clear that the technology for resuscitation will be developed, cryonics
organizations and humanity survive to develop such technology, or that the
future will be interested in resuscitating people from cryopreservation.</p>
<p>The model presented makes the assumption that a person has a given age
and has the option of waiting for signing up for cryonics every year
up to their expected year of death. So, for example, a person that is
20 years old now is able to plan signing up when they are 20 years old,
21 years, 22 years and so on up to 78 years. The value of cryonics is
calculated, and the value of a regular death is tacitly assumed to be
<span>$</span>0.</p>

<h3 id="Motivation_Drift"><a class="hanchor" href="#Motivation_Drift">Motivation Drift</a></h3>
<!--TODO: find out whether there has been any research into the concrete shape
of motivation drift-->
<p><code>prob_signup</code> is a function that calculates the probability of
signing up for cryonics after having waited up to having a certain
age. It seems clear that people lose motivation to finish plans over
time, especially if they are unpleasant or complex.</p>
<p>A good example for this is people being motivated at the start of the
year to do regular exercise: How many of those actually keep their
promises to themselves? They might start off exercising, but after the
first few weeks the first people drop out, and and a couple of months
there is nearly nobody left still going to the gym except the ones who
already did it before. It seems like there is a strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean">regression to
the mean</a> in
regards to action: Most regular actions are replaced by inaction, most
strong values are replaced by apathy over time. A similar phenomenon
seems likely for signing up for cryonics: At first, people are very
enthusiastic about signing up, but then loose interest as time progresses.</p>
<p>It isn't obvious to me how strong motivation drift is and how
it develops over time (some people might regain motivation
after some time), but intuitively it seems like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric
distribution</a>. The
reasoning is as follows: Imagine that a thousand people have the
motivation to perform a given action <span class="mjpage"><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="1.395ex" height="1.676ex" style="vertical-align: -0.338ex;" viewBox="0 -576.1 600.5 721.6" role="img" focusable="false" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="MathJax-SVG-1-Title">

imagine a thousand independent identical copies of oneself planning on
executing a complex plan one year ahead. How many of those would actually
follow through on that plan? Intuitively, I'd say that it can't be much
higher than 95%, possibly much lower, especially for something as complex
and time-consuming as signing up for cryonics.</p>
<pre><code>decay=0.95
function prob_signup(age)
    return decay^(age-curage)
end
</code></pre>
<p>Interestingly, this does not mean that the decision of whether to be
cryogenically preserved or not is then set in stone as soon as possible:
<em>Cryonics memberships are very easy to cancel</em>, very often a simple
email and a cessation of paying membership fees suffices. Signing up for
cryonics earlier protects against regression to the mean, which means
apathy or lack of motivation towards cryonics, but does not protect
against changing ones mind about cryonics: If one becomes convinced it's
bullshit later, one can easily get out (much more easily than getting in).
On the other hand, there might be a feeling of considerable sunk cost
due to already paid membership fees and the acquired life insurance.</p>
<p>In this analysis, it will be assumed that once one is signed up for
cryonics, one stays signed up for it.</p>
<!--TODO: Image here-->
<h3 id="Dying_Before_Signing_Up"><a class="hanchor" href="#Dying_Before_Signing_Up">Dying Before Signing Up</a></h3>
<p>If you die before signing up, all possible value (or disvalue) of cryonics
gets lost. So we want to calculate the probability of dying before having
a certain age given being currently <code>curage</code> years old.</p>
<p>Mortality rates are usually calculated using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_distribution">Gompertz
distribution</a>. I
determined the b and eta values by eyeballing <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=life+expectancy+of+a+0+year+old+german">Wolfram
Alpha</a>
and using a calculator in <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/estimating-aggregate-wild-animal-suffering-from-reproductive-age-and-births-per-female/#Choosing_a_distribution" title="Estimating Aggregate Wild-Animal Suffering from Reproductive Age and Births per Female">Tomasik
2016</a>.</p>
<!--TODO: find out which exact values statisticians
use, then use them: Maybe take cue from here:
https://www.gwern.net/Longevity#population-survival-curve-->
<pre><code>b=0.108
eta=0.0001

function gompertz(age)
    return math.exp(-eta*(math.exp(b*age)-1))
end
</code></pre>
<p><code>gompertz</code> returns the probability of reaching <code>age</code>
starting from birth, but I need the probability of reaching
<code>age</code> given one is already <code>curage</code> years old. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">Bayes

that</p>

have to apply in the case that the probabilities of reaching <code>age</code>
is not completely independent of the probability of reaching <code>curage</code>,
but those are difficult to estimate and will not be implemented here.</p>
<p>This way, one can implement the probability of living until <code>age</code> given

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity_escape_velocity">Longevity Escape
Velocity</a> (short
LEV) is the name for the possible year when anti-aging technology becomes
so good that people can be rejuvenated faster than they age. Although the
concept is considered idle speculation in many circles, many futurists
justify not signing up for cryonics because they expect that LEV will
arrive during their lifetime, and see no reason to sign up for a cryonics
membership they are probably not going to need anyway. In this text,
I will consider LEV by assuming there will be a certain year after which
the probability of death from aging is practically zero.</p>
<p>I somewhat arbitrarily set this year to 2080<!--TODO: find some
estimates of LEV, maybe Metaculus?-->, though many futurists seem more
optimistic<!--TODO source-->:</p>
<pre><code>levyear=2080
</code></pre>
<p>However, there are some reasons why one might want to stay signed up
to cryonics even after LEV—there might be types of accidents where
large parts of the body are destroyed in ways that both lead to death
and that regenerative medicine at the time can't handle, and so one will
want to be preserved until the missing bodyparts can be re-created and
resuscitation is possible. Another risk to life even after LEV is new
and for some time deadly diseases. This analysis does not include such
considerations (yet).</p>

<h2 id="Calculating_the_Cost"><a class="hanchor" href="#Calculating_the_Cost">Calculating the Cost</a></h2>
<p>Calculating the cost is comparatively straightforward, but there are
some hidden variables (like opportunity costs and social costs) that
have to be considered (not all of these in this text).</p>
<p>The raw cost for cryonics depends heavily on the organisation choosen for
preservation, the price ranges from ~<span>$</span>20000 to ~<span>$</span>250000<!--TODO: Sources
for these, maybe more exact numbers for different organisations.-->. In
this case, I choose the costs for neurocryopreservation at Alcor, though
this analysis should be extended to other organisations.</p>
<p>Raw cryonics cost can be split into three different parts:
membership fees, comprehensive member standby costs and the cost for
cryopreservation.</p>
<pre><code>function cost(age)
    return membership_fees(age)+pres_cost(age)+cms_fees(age)
end

<ol>
<li>The person considering signing up for cryonics is over 18 years old.</li>
<li> If the person is under 25 years old, they are a

be more likely to be rich and educated, this seems likely,
though maybe a bit classist. The code can be changed if personal
need arises.</li>
<li>If the person is over 25 years old, they are not a student.</li>
<li>The person stays a member until their death (otherwise the cryonics
arrangement doesn't apply).</li>
<li> The membership fees will not be changed drastically over time. In
fact, inflation adjusted prices for cryonics have mostly stayed
constant (see chart), so this is a reasonable assumption.</li>

<!--TODO: Dangers from incompetent revival -->
<p>Much ink and pixels have been spilled on the question of the quality of
the future, very little of it trying to make accurate or even resolvable
predictions. Anders Sandberg summarizes the current approaches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of this discourse relates to the issue of whether history is
cyclical, spiralling, progressive or regressive. Is there a particular
shape to history? If there is, then this makes a strong long-term
prediction about the future. While this could be a teleological arc
towards completion, it could also be an unavoidable thermodynamic decline,
the environmentally biased random walk of evolution or an emergent
trajectory set by a mixture of forces, events and individuals. In
a sense a sufficiently large-scale macrohistorical theory will tend
to become a prospective universal history. Still, even the idea of a
prospective history is tied to a particular (forward-looking, linear)
concept of time: many macrohistorians have been concerned with very
different concepts of time and its structure.<br>
Another key issue is how the patterns of history are caused and shaped.
Beside any transcendental or environmental forces shaping history,
who (if any) are the vanguard? This might for example be enlightened
leaders (Ssu-Ma Ch’ien, Sarkar), creative elites or intellectuals
(Toynbee, Gramsci), people seizing power (Khaldun), or the proletariat
(Marx). An issue that will be relevant in this book is to what degree we
can expect deliberate shaping of future trajectories to be possible. Many
macrohistorical theories deny this, since the shape is largely determined
by general patterns rather than individual decisions, yet some are also
compatible with contingency and freedom along some dimensions, or that
certain stages and patterns can be broken under the right conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>—Anders Sandberg, “Grand Futures”, 2023</em></p>
<p>One way to look at the question could be to find clear
metrics that encapsulate the most important human values and
then fund a prediction market to bet on these metrics. This
could include the power of humanity to make most important
decisions regarding its development and resource management,
diversity among human beings, average happiness and lifespans and
other variables such as inequality regarding resources (see also <a href="https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/what-proxies-to-use-for-flow-through.html" title="What proxies to use for flow-through effects?">Shulman
2013</a> for a more
extensive list of metrics for flow-through effects, which could be
used to evaluate the general quality of life in the future). <a href="http://lukemuehlhauser.com/three-wild-speculations-from-amateur-quantitative-macrohistory/" title="Three wild speculations from amateur quantitative macrohistory">Muehlhauser
2017a</a>
and <a href="http://lukemuehlhauser.com/industrial-revolution/" title="How big a deal was the Industrial Revolution?">Muehlhauser
2017b</a>
find that along 5 different metrics, human well-being has been improving
increasingly rapidly since the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>But a much simpler way of approaching the topic could be the following:
One takes arguments from both sides (proclaiming positive futures
and negative futures) and prematurely concludes that the future is on
average going to be neutral, with a high variance in the result. But
some problems present themselves: In different value systems, "neutral"
means very different things. Strictly speaking, a utilitarian would
see human extinction as neutral, but not net neutral (the utility of
a world without any sentient beings is exactly 0, which is presumably
lower than the current value of the world), anti-natalists consider an
empty world to be a positive thing, and most people working on preventing
human extinction would consider such a world to be a gigantic loss of
opportunity, and therefore net negative.</p>
<p>There seems to be no simple way to resolve these conflicts, otherwise it
would have been written down up to now. But it seems like most people
would take the current state of affairs as neutral, with improvements
in happiness, meaning and wealth to be positive, and decreases in
those to be negative. Also, they don't see dying tomorrow as a neutral
event.</p>

<p>Here I will assume that</p>
<ul>
<li>  One can exclude future life years with astronomically high values.
Although these deserve further consideration,
they are avoided to in order to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_mugging">Pascal's

arguments. Also, they might have quite small probabilities, and
may be even harder to forecast than naive success from cryonics</li>
<li>  Future life years can be averaged in their quality, and that
average has monetary value</li>
<li>  Future lifeyears are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference#Temporal_discounting">temporally

</ul>
<p><a href="./doc/philosophy/ethics/discounting_future_health_greaves_2017.pdf" title="Discounting future health">Greaves
2017</a>
argues against pure positive discounting for health (i.e QALYs):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A discount rate should be applied to future health for two
reasons. First, to correct for the possibility that the beneficial
future effects of a proposed health intervention, in the relevant
sense of 'effect', are smaller than the model's naïve calculation
suggests. Second, to take into account the fact that earlier health
benefits are generally more instrumentally valuable than otherwise-equal
later ones.</p>
<p>In both cases, the use of a discount rate for future health is not
the only way to model the effects in question. Alternatively, one could
(i) explicitely represent the various possible actual effects of one's
intervention and their probabilities, and perform a corresponding explicit
expected-value calculation, eschewing the use of the 'naïve calculation'
as an estimaate of effects on future health, and (ii) explicitely model
the instrumental as well as the intrinsic benefits of health improvements
one is considering. If one did both of those things, there would be no
reasons of the kinds we have accepted for discounting future health.</p>

<p>She also argues against applying considerations from diminishing marginal
returns to health (although it must be noted that this analysis does
not explicitely use QALY numbers for cryonics, since they have not been
collected by healthcare departments yet):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this does not give rise to any phenomenon of diminishing
marginal returns of health to well-being when units of health are
measured in QALYs, because the QALY scale has already more-or-less
been constructed to be linear in well-being. There is therefore
no reason based in considerations of diminishing marginal returns
to discount future QALYs.</p>

<p>Additionally, problems with interpersonal utility comparison do not apply
in this case, since the externalities from signing up for cryonics are
disregarded in this analysis.</p>
<h4 id="QALYs_and_VSL"><a class="hanchor" href="#QALYs_and_VSL">QALYs and VSL</a></h4>
<p>There are two different methods of putting a value on human life:
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life">VSL</a> and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year">QALY</a>.

<span>$</span>181893 for the value of a year of life in Australia, and <span>$</span>50000 as the
"de facto international standard most private and government-run health
insurance plans worldwide use to determine whether to cover a new medical
procedure". This number seems like a good conservative estimate.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this approximately equals a year of waking hours worth
the minimum wage in some countries (<code>$\$10*16*7*52=\$58240$</code>)<!--TODO:
add https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country-->.</p>

<p><em>this graph is not based on real data and only here for illustrative purposes</em></p>
<p>But one can take another factor into account: Most negative future
scenarios don't lead to resuscitation (civilisational collapse, stable
totalitarianism, existential catastrophes like AI failure, nuclear
war, biotechnological disaster and natural catastrophe all reduce
human capabilities or keep them constant, preventing the development
of resuscitation technology). In most of the negative futures, there
are either no more humans around or people don't have time, energy or
resources to bring people back from cryonic preservation (if indeed they
still <em>are</em> in preservation by that point), and for malicious actors, in
most scenarios it is easier to create new people than to bring preserved
people back.</p>
<p>This effect might be dampened by the consideration that most possible
futures have net-negative value, but on the other hand, nearly all of
those futures don't lead to resuscitation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gMzWWtdsArkwqNJEK/why-might-the-future-be-good" title="Why might the future be good?">Christiano 2013</a> outlines two reasons that indicate that the future will be good:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Decisions will be made by people whose lives are morally valuable
and who want the best for themselves. They will bargain amongst each
other and create a world that is good to live in. Because my values are
roughly aligned with their aggregate preferences, I expect them to create
a rich and valuable world (by my lights as well as theirs).<br></li>
<li>Some people in the future will have altruistic values broadly similar
to my own, and will use their influence to create a rich and valuable
world (by my lights as well as theirs).</li>
</ol>

<p>This would mean that the probability distribution over the value of
a lifeyear in the future conditional on being resuscitated could look
like this:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/30/ascended-economy/">ascended
economy</a> is a
scenario where the development of capitalism diverges significantly from
the desires of humans, leading to most (if not all) of humanity becoming
extinct. It seems highly unlikely, but possible that cryopreserved
humans are placed into the hands of an algorithm that invests the
money in the relevant funds to resuscitate the cryopreserved humans at a
certain point. This algorithm could receive little (or no) information
on what to do with the resuscitated humans afterwards, leading either
to these humans quickly dying again because of an economy where they
are worthless, or being kept alive solely for fulfilling the contract
that is embedded in the algorithm. This might lead to insanity-inducing
boredom as the humans are kept alive as long as algorithm manages to,
possibly hundreds or thousands of years. This would have net-negative
value for the people resuscitated.</p>

<p>In a future where agents that don't care about humans find the
cryopreserved remains of humans, they might be interested in extracting
information from those brains. If it is not possible to extract this
information without reviving the cryopreserved people, they might
resuscitate them and then interrogate these revived people for a very
long time, with little regard for their well-being.</p>

<p>A relatively common worry that prevents people from signing up for
cryonics is a scenario in which their brain is scanned and they are
transformed into a whole-brain emulation, which will then be used
for slave labour or worse. This is often accompanied by linking <a href="https://qntm.org/mmacevedo" title="Lena">qntm
2021</a>.</p>
<p>For this to occur, several things need to happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>The technology for whole-brain emulations is developed</li>
<li>The brain of the person is scanned</li>
<li>The scanned person is forced to work</li>
<li>Optionally, the preserved person is copied many times over and the copies are all used for work</li>
</ol>
<p>For 2 to occur, somebody needs to be interested in emulating
the person in question. This could be because they are part
of the cryonics organisation, and want to fulfill the contract
that the cryonics organisation and its members have signed,
or because they want to use the person for slave labour.
In the latter case, they will usually seek the most profitable
option, and several forces work against the preserved person
being that option:</p>
<ul>
<li>If whole-brain emulation is wide-spread, and copying of whole-brain emulations is easy:
<ul>
<li>Competition among whole-brain emulations is likely fierce, and labor by emulations would be as cheap as slave labour (so there is no particular reason to enslave emulations)</li>
<li>The average emulation is likely very competent and elite, and a much better worker than the average college-educated person (<a href="https://ageofem.com" title="The Age of Em">Hanson 2016 pp. 161-163</a>) estimates that most ems are going to be copies of fewer than a thousand or so original humans, each most likely again selected from several thousand individual childhoods to select the most capable educational lineage)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If whole-brain emulation is not wide-spread, then the more the more more-obscure whole-brain emulation is, the more unlikely it is that cryonics and whole-brain emulation will "come into contact", since cryonics is also obscure and the number of preserved patients is tiny (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vBrlNvPkPQbLKxtSUlTF_ZpUS4lwW2W7lENRj9Gdk3I/edit#gid=662993486">&lt;500</a>, with <a href="https://lessdead.com/how-many-humans-will-have-their-brain-preserved-forecasts-and-trends">much more to come</a>)
<ul>
<li>It seems unlikely that whole-brain emulation will stay restricted to a niche, since it will likely require large amounts of computational power and high-tech scanning facilities which are only possible with large amounts of capital</li>
<li>A factor working against this is that whole-brain emulation and cryonics are discussed within in the same subculture</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Uploading a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryopreservation#Vitrification">vitrified</a> brain seems to be at least as difficult as scanning a freshly deceased brain or a living brain, and possibly much more difficult, since one would need to repair structural damage done by outdated cryopreservation methods (why not vitrify a recently deanimated person with the newest cryogenic technology, and then scan &amp; upload them, instead of trying to fix old somewhat broken brains?), so it would probably not be more economically viable</li>
<li>It appears more likely than not that cryonics organisations will attempt to prevent the theft of preserved humans (although the organisations could fail and abandon or sell the preserved humans)</li>
<li>There would have to be no laws protecting cryogenically preserved humans (or the emulations resulting from them), but laws protecting living or recently deanimated people</li>
</ul>
<p>A basic tension is that if whole-brain emulation is wide-spread and the
incentive is economic, then it'll use more competitive brains from living
humans that are easier to scan. If whole-brain emulation is obscure,
it's unlikely that it and cryonics will come into contact in a way that
harms cryonics patients (at the very least, it would be counted as grave
robbery and body snatching).</p>
<p>That said, if scanning living or recently deceased humans is illegal
or very hard, but uploading and using cryogenically preserved humans is
legal or less difficult, then this might be a legitimate worry, because
a preserved human can't take any actions to prevent this scenario.</p>

<p>Although not a failsafe measure, steps can be taken to reduce
the risks from hellish scenarios above by making arrangements with
cryonics organisations. This may include not wanting cryopreservation
to continue in an ascended economy, objecting to revival as an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_emulation">emulation</a> or revival
after more than a certain number of years (to prevent being resuscitated
in an incomprehensibly strange and alien world).</p>
<h4 id="Other_Thoughts"><a class="hanchor" href="#Other_Thoughts">Other Thoughts</a></h4>
<p>Many people argue that the value of a year of life in the future might
be much lower than in the present, because friends and familiy are not
around, and it is very likely that the future will be extremely alien and
unfamiliar.</p>
<p>These are valid considerations, but can be dampened a bit: Humans have
shown to adapt to very different and varied circumstances, and humans
today feel that modern life in big cities with regular calendars and
highly structured lives without any worries about survival is normal,
while for most humans who ever lived, this would be anything but. One
can speculate that very similar facts will also hold for the future
(becoming increasingly unlikely the further resuscitation lies in the
future). There would certainly be a big culture shock in the future,
but it seems not qualitatively different from the shock people have
when they visit different countries today. It is possible that future
societies might try to help people with this kind of future shock,
but that is of course far from certain.</p>
<p>It is true that most cryonicists will not be able to convince their
friends and family to sign up for it too, so they will be alone in
the future at first. People today sometimes leave their friends and
even families to move to other places, but those people seem to be
the exception rather than the norm. However, people nearly always
move on with their life, even as they get divorced, get estranged
from their friends or see their children less regularly—they
don't seem to prefer death to continuing their lives without
specific people. This consideration doesn't seem to be a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality/is-that-your-true-rejection">true
rejection</a>.</p>

<p>Specific equations and values have been
proposed, usually yielding probability of success
0 &lt; x &lt; 10%. For example, Steven Harris in 1989 estimated
<a href="http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/WillCryonicsWork.html">0.2-15%</a>,
R. Mike Perry in the same article runs a different analysis to arrive at
13-77%, <a href="http://www.merkle.com/cryo/probability.html">Ralph Merkle</a>
suggests &gt;85% (conditional on things like good preservation,
no dystopia, and nanotech); Robin Hanson calculated in 2009 a

<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3j/rationality_cryonics_and_pascals_wager/">23%</a>;
Mike Darwin in 2011 (personal communication)

in 2011 provides a calculator with suggested

estimate of cryonics working of 18% (n=1100) and among ‘veterans’ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131229234145/http://squid314.livejournal.com/349656.html">the

<p>Besides these estimates, there exist also two related questions
on the prediction website Metaculus.<!--TODO: dig out manifold questions on this--></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/455/if-you-die-today-and-get-cryonically-frozen-will-you-wake-up/">"If you die today and get cryonically frozen, will you "wake up"?"</a> receives 5% (n=436).</li>

</ul>
<p>I am not sure where the difference comes from, perhaps either
from worries about the quality of current preservation or from
a low trust in the longevity of cryonics organisations. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qn7c7rYmYx3KtqvhXTUGiiyuBk5e9kG3sA3jF-4zk6U/">This google
sheet</a>
contains 7 estimates of success: 0.04%, 0.223%, 29%, 6.71%, 14.86%,
0.23% and 22.8%, with various different models underlying these estimates.</p>
<p>For forecast aggregation, the <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/hjiBqAJNKhfJFq7kf/p/sMjcjnnpoAQCcedL2">geometric mean of odds is currently
SOTA</a>,
so we will be using that, which results in a chance of ~13%:</p>
<!--TODO: maybe load individual forecasts from Metaculus private data?-->

<p>(If we remove the numbers from the 2012 LessWrong Survey, the aggregated
probability drops to ~5%.)</p>
<p>It would certainly be interesting to set up a prediction market for
this question, or get a team of superforecasters to estimate it,
but basically, it seems like for a young or middle-aged person, the
estimated probability is around 10%. However, the people surveyed are
often sympathetic to cryonics or even signed up. People are in general
overconfident, things generally don't happen, so being conservative by
halving the estimate seems like a good idea.</p>
<pre><code>prob_succ=0.05
</code></pre>
<p>This is quite pessimistic: It assumes that cryobiology will make no
progress <em>whatsoever</em> in the fidelity of the preserved tissue (remember,
the probabilities given are usually for the success of a preservation
given that it happens <em>now</em>).</p>

<p>Conditional on being revived, what is the average life expectancy?</p>
<p>If revival is achieved, it seems highly likely that aging and most
degenerative diseases have been eradicated (it makes little sense to
revive a person that is going to die again in 10 years). Also, most
revival scenarios hinge upon either the feasibility of very advanced
nanotechnology, which seems to be highly conducive to fixing aging,
or on whole brain emulation scenarios, which would likely make aging
unnecessary (why degrade a digital brain?).</p>
<p>If revival happens, there are still risks from accidents and homicide or
suicide that can kill the resuscitated cryonicist, as well as existential
risks that face all of humanity.</p>
<p>The website Polstats <a href="http://polstats.com/#!/life">illustrates</a>
the risks purely from accidents and homicides
using data from the <a href="http://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/mortality-risk">Information Insurance
Institute</a>. They
arrive at "a much more impressive 8,938 years" average life
expectancy. An <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3044240">answer</a>

<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3044194/whats-the-average-life-expectancy-if-only-dying-from-accidents">"What's the average life expectancy if only dying from
accidents?"</a>
arrives at 2850 years.</p>

2019</a>
conservatively estimates a life expectancy of ~1000 years for each
individual human after LEV.</p>
<p>The life
expectancy of cryonics is thus is (just taking the average of these three values)

<p>My rough guess is that resuscitated cryonicists will on average live ~4200
years, with significant uncertainty and leverage, if the cryonicist is
particularly careful to avoid accidents and (<em>checks notes</em>) suicide.</p>
<pre><code>years_gain=4260
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>That number should be qualified further in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Em">"Age of
Em"</a> scenario: that
scenario will contain less natural risks (emulation can be backed up,
they live in a simulated world where homicide risks and car accidents
make no sense), but an em also suffers from the risk of not having
enough money to continue being run, and from the fact that the
em era might not last several subjective millennia. Furthermore,
it might be that multiple copies of the emulated cryonicist are
executed. This scenario deserves further consideration (see also
<a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/uploads.html" title="If Uploads Come First">Hanson 1994</a>).
I will not take into account the possibility of multiple
copies of the same person, and assume that only one emulation is being
run (to avoid tricky problems in aggregation).</p>

<p>The probabilities, pathways, causes, risk factors, inhibitors,

<p>It seems like not all people who sign up for cryonics remain cryonicists
until their death, and not all cryonicists who die as members actually
get preserved.</p>
<p>There seems to be very little data about this question, but as an
extremely conservative estimate I would put the ratio of members of
cryonics organizations who actually get preserved at 90% (this number
doesn't make any statement about the quality of preservation). I have
mailed Alcor asking for the real value, but they haven't responded yet. A
cryonics member can increase this number by being diligent about their
cryonics arrangement, living near the preservation facility before death,
informing family members about their arrangement, trying to lead a safe
life and keeping contact to their cryonics organisation.</p>

<h3 id="Quality_of_Preservation"><a class="hanchor" href="#Quality_of_Preservation">Quality of Preservation</a></h3>
<p>A common reason for cryocrastination seems to be the belief that deaths
at an earlier age have causes that make successful cryopreservation less
likely, and that it is therefore not worth it to sign up early.</p>
<p>To determine whether this is correct, one can investigate the leading
causes of death by age group and estimate their penalty on successful
cryopreservation. Note that my medical knowledge is very slim, and I might
be missing many obvious factors.</p>
<p>But isn't this already priced in into the probabilistic estimates of
success? Basically, yes. But In order to tease out the optimal point for
signing up for cryonics, I will have to include them in this analysis
again. That is unfortunate, but I think the benefit in information is
worth the cost in (slight) bias, and it adds to the conservatism of
this estimate. Interested readers are encouraged to try to modify the
probability of success and observe the resulting changes in value.</p>
<p>I obtain the 10 leading causes of death by age group from a <a href="./doc/epidemiology/10_leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_cdc_2018.pdf" title="10 Leading Causes of Death by Age Group, United States – 2018">2018 CDC

<p>The causes of death, and their effect on successful cryopreservation

number:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;1 year:
<ul>
<li>Cause 1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect">Congenital Anomalies</a>: 70%; brain might already be damaged at birth, or become damaged during birth, but many deaths seem to be due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_heart_defect">congenital heart defects</a>, which only decreases oxygen supply, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube_defect">neural tube defect</a>, which directly affets the nervous system and often the brain</li>
<li>Cause 2: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation">Short Gestation</a>: 90%; might reduce damage to the brain because of smaller head, but also baby might be born already dead for a while</li>
<li>Cause 3: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complications_of_pregnancy">Pregnancy Complication</a>: 75%</li>
<li>Cause 4: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome">Sudden Infant Death Syndrome</a>: 50%; since death usually occurs during sleep, it might take quite a long time until death is noticed and cooling/cryopreservation is initiated</li>
<li>Cause 5: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident">Accident/Unintentional Injury</a>: 55%; see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventable_causes_of_death#Among_children_worldwide">unintentional injuries in children worldwide</a>, traffic accidents, falls and toxins seem to especially harmful to the brain</li>
<li>Cause 6: Placenta Cord. Membranes (I didn't find the wikipedia page for this): 60%; but I have no clue what this is, just taking a guessed baserate</li>
<li>Cause 7: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis">Bacterial Sepsis</a>: 65%; the brain seems to be the second most commonly infected, after the lungs</li>
<li>Cause 8: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease">Circulatory System Disease</a>: 80%; should be noted quickly, but problems with providing oxygen to brain</li>
<li>Cause 9: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome">Respiratory Distress</a>: 70%; wikipedia says it may cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_hemorrhage">intracranial hemmorhage</a></li>
<li>Cause 10: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgaleal_hemorrhage">Neonatal hemorrhage</a>: 40%; bleeding inside the brain &amp; dying as a result is probably pretty bad</li>

<li>Cause 2: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect">Congenital Anomalies</a>: 75%; here already slightly less because if somebody survived one year, the damage can't be as substantial</li>
<li>Cause 3: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide">Homicide</a>: 50%; I didn't look for the exact causes of death in infant homicide (<em>shudder</em>), but a lot is probably very damaging to the brain and/or collateral to homicide in the rest of the family? Perhaps also by the infant being killed by parents (probably shaking/suffocation)</li>
<li>Cause 4: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer">Malignant Neoplasms</a>: 60%; Wikipedia says that "In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors are most common", death probably occurs in a hospital which makes the number not too low</li>
<li>Cause 5: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza">Influenza</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia">Pneumonia</a>: 85%; seems to primarily damage the lungs, perhaps collateral brain damage due to lack of oxygen</li>
<li>Cause 6: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease">Heart Disease</a>: 85%; similar to above</li>
<li>Cause 7: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_development#perinatal">Perinatal Period</a>: 60%; This seems to just refer to a period in human fetal development and I don't understand why it is listed as a cause of death, so I'm taking the prior from above.</li>
<li>Cause 8: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis">Septicemia</a>: 65%; taken from bacterial sepsis above</li>
<li>Cause 9: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease">Chronic Low. Respiratory Disease</a>: 85%; not sure what exactly this is referring to, so just taking the numbers from influenza and pneumonia</li>
<li>Cause 10: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease">Cerebrovascular Disease</a>: 30%; this directly affects the brain. Bad.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>5-9 years:
<ul>
<li>Cause 1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident">Accident/Unintentional Injury</a>: 55%</li>
<li>Cause 2: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer">Malignant Neoplasms</a>: 60%</li>

<li>Cause 9: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis">Septicemia</a>: 65%</li>
<li>Cause 10: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor">Benign Neoplasms</a>: 30%; if this leads to death, it usually happens in the brain: "Unlike most benign tumors elsewhere in the body, benign brain tumors can be life-threatening."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>10-14 years:
<ul>
<li>Cause 1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident">Accident/Unintentional Injury</a>: 55%</li>
<li>Cause 2: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide">Suicide</a>: 60%; but I haven't investigated the leading methods of suicide for 10-14 year olds (partially because reading about it is probably horrifying). My guess would be that at this age, suicide is less often commited by using a gun, and more often by overdosing on pills, cutting &amp; then bleeding out, or jumping off heights. Of these, especially jumping seems very damaging to the brain. It also seems more likely than not that cryonicists are less likely to commit suicide than the general population.</li>
<li>Cause 3: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer">Malignant Neoplasms</a>: 60%</li>
<li>Cause 4: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect">Congenital Anomalies</a>: 80%; since the person survived this far (although already existing brain damage will of course persist during preservation)</li>
<li>Cause 5: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide">Homicide</a>: 50%</li>

<p>For the age groups starting from age 15, <a href="./doc/epidemiology/data_brief_mortality_in_the_united_states_nchs_2018.pdf" title="Data Brief 355. Mortality in the United States, 2018">NCHS
2018</a>
provided the number of deaths by age group (I don't understand why they
had to start at age 15 and not just include the whole data).</p>
<p>For the missing first 4 categories (0 to 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-9 years,
and 10-14 years), total deaths were calculated under the
assumption that the top 10 causes of deaths account for 73.8%
of the total number of deaths in that age group (see <a href="doc/epidemiology/mortality_in_the_united_states_xu_et_al_2020.pdf" title="Mortality in the United States, 2018">Xu et al.
2020</a>
p. 2).</p>
<p>For every age group, it was assumed that the average preservation quality
for the remaining causes of death was 60%.</p>
<p>I can now write another function that calculates the expected quality
of cryopreservation given that one signs up at a certain age.</p>
<p>This can be done by "simulating" signing up at a certain age, and then
observing which deaths one might have died, and their implications for
cryopreservation.</p>
<pre><code>alldeaths=0
weighteddeaths=0
</code></pre>
<p>This is achieved by iterating through <code>deathcause_impact</code> and only observing
deaths if they're above the signup age:</p>
<pre><code>for i=1, #deathcause_impact do
    local l=deathcause_impact[i].lowbound
    local u=deathcause_impact[i].upbound
    local factor=1
</code></pre>
<p>If the signup age is in the given age group, one needs to calculate a
weighing factor for the time the cryonicists will spend in the given
age group:</p>
<pre><code>if l&lt;age and u&gt;age then
    factor=(age-l)/(u-l)
end
</code></pre>
<p>Then, in case the age group lies further ahead in the future than <code>age</code>,
one can calculate the deaths weighted by impact on cryopreservation
and prevalence (and, in one case, the factor for the time spent in the
age group):</p>
<pre><code>if age&lt;=u then
    alldeaths=alldeaths+factor*deathcause[i].total_deaths
    for j=1, #deathcause[i].numbers do
        weighteddeaths=weighteddeaths+factor*deathcause[i].numbers[j]*deathcause[i].impact[j]
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This adds up the deaths that have occurred, as well as the deaths weighted
by (hypothetical) preservation quality.</p>
<p>Now, <code>weighteddeaths</code> should contain a number whose meaning is roughly
"number of deaths that lead to successful cryopreservation, relative
to optimal conditions, under real world death circumstances", and
<code>alldeaths</code> should contain a number that means "number of deaths that
lead to successful cryopreservation, under ideal circumstances".</p>
<p>The factor that now interests us is <code>weighteddeaths/alldeaths</code>, so the
function executes</p>
<pre><code>return weighteddeaths/alldeaths
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can simulate whether, in this model, age of signing up has any
impact on the quality of preservation:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; avg_pres_quality(30)
0.64963177178483
&gt; avg_pres_quality(40)
0.65111068607725
&gt; avg_pres_quality(50)
0.6520624345423
&gt; avg_pres_quality(60)
0.65100001940528
&gt; avg_pres_quality(70)
0.64929715809787
</code></pre>
<p>Apparently, the differences in quality of preservation by age are
negligible, although the low expected quality of preservation is quite
shocking.</p>
<p>The low amount of variation is probably due to the fact that most people
die of old age and not due to accidents during their lifetime.</p>

<h3 id="Surviving_Until_LEV"><a class="hanchor" href="#Surviving_Until_LEV">Surviving Until LEV</a></h3>
<p>The benefit of cryonics is only realized in one case: One lives to the

<p>Not only does extinction endanger the cryonicist's revival, it
also (in expectation) shortens their lifespan <em>after</em> revival. To
estimate, it is important to know whether the revival happens
<em>before</em> or <em>after</em> 2100 (the arbitrary cutoff date when the <a href="./ea/are_we_living_at_the_hinge_of_history_macaskill_2020.pdf">hinge of
history</a>
is over and humanity has passed the time of perils). The years of revival
before 2100 are in expectation less valuable than the years after 2100.</p>
<p>This can be easily expressed by taking the extinction risk during the
lifespan after revival and subtracting the extinction risk before revival,
no complicated calculations required.</p>

<h2 id="Putting_it_All_Together"><a class="hanchor" href="#Putting_it_All_Together">Putting it All Together</a></h2>
<p>One can then simply calculate the benefit of signing up for cryonics at

return expected_post_revival_years*val_year*prob_liveto(age)*prob_diebeforelev(age)*avg_pres_quality(age)

<p>The cost is easier to calculate, as it has fewer factors:</p>
<pre><code>function cost(age)
        return membership_fees(age)+pres_cost(age)+cms_fees(age)
end
</code></pre>
<p>The the value of signing up for cryonics is simply the expected cost
subtracted from the expected benefit:</p>

<p>It is now optimal to wait for 30 years, with an added value of
~<span>$</span>800. This is probably due to very slight variations in the quality
of cryopreservation at different ages of death.</p>
<p>So in the case of high self-trust, it seems possible that limited amounts
of cryocrastination might indeed be rational, although the benefits
are so small that they might be swamped by even slight changes to the
factors for the quality of cryopreservation.</p>
<p>And, in case anybody was wondering, at age 26 the model also recommends
deferring to age 52:</p>
<pre><code>$ lua cryoyear.lua 26 50000 0.05 0.6 4500 1 | sort -n | tail -1
1202556.0910284: 52
</code></pre>
<p>For ages 20-25, it recommends waiting until the age of 52, and if you're
older, it usually recommends to sign up at 54 (at ages above 54 it tells
you to sign up immediately).</p>
<h3 id="The_Critics_Scenario"><a class="hanchor" href="#The_Critics_Scenario">The Critic's Scenario</a></h3>
<p>Somebody who is very critical might object and argue that the probability
of success is much lower, and even if cryonics succeeds, it will not
lead to extremely long lifespans. Let's say they also don't believe in value
drift. Such a person might propose the following assignment of variables:</p>
<pre><code>curage=20
val_year=50000
prob_succ=0.01
years_gain=50
prob_pres=0.6
decay=1
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, signing up for cryonics has negative value that converges
to 0 the older one gets:</p>

<p>What if a technological singularity (and thus longevity escape velocity)
happen fairly soon?<!--TODO: Epoch/Metaculus timelines for full automation
& the likes--></p>
<p>This can be calculated easily, just adjust the parameters. For a
singularity in 2030, for someone who's 30 years old now:</p>
<pre><code>$ lua cryoyear.lua 30 50000 0.05 0.9 4260 0.95 180 90000 2030 | sort -n | tail -4

-6014.0706728592: 78
-5482.8543274028: 79
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the optimal time to sign up is when the person is 79
years old, and then it's still negative.</p>
<p>For a singularity in 2040 we get positive values:</p>
<pre><code>$ lua cryoyear.lua 30 50000 0.05 0.9 4260 0.95 180 90000 2040 | sort -n | tail -4

7279.17233885: 44
8690.3632744588: 45
</code></pre>
<p>Curiously, the optimal time to sign up is <em>in the year</em> in which we get
longevity escape velocity. Strange.</p>
<p>And for a singularity in 2050:</p>
<pre><code>$ lua cryoyear.lua 30 50000 0.05 0.9 4260 0.95 180 90000 2050 | sort -n | tail -4

<p>In this case, the model recommends to sign up in 2038.</p>

<p>It is possible to think of many other modifications to the parameters

such as adding models for the probability of the development of life
extension technology in the near future.</p>
<p>The reader is encouraged to modify the variables and execute the script

and if yes, whether cryocrastination would be a good idea.</p>

<p>I know more people who are planning to sign up for cryonics Real

<p>In case you're now convinced that signing up for cryonics is the right
thing to do for you, great! I encourage you strongly to <strong>sign up as
quickly as possible</strong>, if your finances allow you to (there are cheaper
associate memberships at Alcor, which get you over most of the hump of
signing up at a much lower cost, which can then be activated at a later
point in time into a full membership quickly, and memberships at the
<a href="https://cryonics.org">Cryonics Institute</a>, which also much cheaper
than Alcor, but require much higher amount of initiative to assure a
quick preservation).</p>

<p>Generally, the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/weBHYgBXg9thEQNEe">Cryonics Signup

lacks information for people outside of the US.</p>
<p>Good luck, and may we see each other one day.</p>
<p>If you are not convinced, that's also fine. If you think you have found a
good counterargument or a flaw in this cost-benefit analysis, feel free
to <a href="./about.html#Contact">contact me</a> (though note that I'm generally
quite unsympathetic to the prevalent position that death and aging are
not clearly and strictly bad, and might be uninterested in discussion

Aubrey de Grey gives a mean of 2038, I believe that number to be

another possibility is being revived and then dying in an accident or war.

<p>The result is certainly interesting: in this model, signing up for
cryonics has a mean value of <span>$</span>18m and a median of ≈-<span>$</span>100k
(perhaps because of longevity escape velocity arriving and making
the value simply the cost for signing up), but with very long tails,
especially on the positive side: a fifth percentile of -<span>$</span>2.15m,
and a 95th percentile of <em>squints</em> <span>$</span>58.5m—quite a range!</p>
<p>The minimum and maximum of the simulation are even more extreme: -<span>$</span>39b
for the minimum and <span>$</span>20b for the maximum (these vary strongly every
time the simulation is run).</p>
<p>Because of these huge numbers, it makes sense to try to visualize them

<p>In this model, signing up for cryonics is still a good idea from a
strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected-value</a>
perspective. But decision processes with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle">precautionary
principle</a> might
be much more wary of doing anything rash before futures with negative
value can be ruled out.</p>

<p>Well, this isn't <em>quite</em> correct. One can imagine a world in which LEV is achieved for normal aging processes, <em>but</em> dying of very bad injuries is still a possibility. In that case, dying from those injuries is possible, but future revival from those injuries could still happen. I won't incorporate that possibility into the model, because that would make it pretty messy.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
