  <p><strong>This text looks at the accuracy of forecasts in relation

  questions: First; is the accuracy higher between forecasts;
  Second; is the accuracy higher between questions; Third: is the
  accuracy higher within questions. These questions are analyzed
  using data from <a href="https://predictionbook.com/">PredictionBook</a> and

<h1>Short and Mid Range Forecasting Accuracy</h1>

<!--http://foresightr.com/2016/05/06/a-brief-history-of-forecasting--></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikiki_Probabilistic_forecasting">Probabilistic forecasting</a>
that aggregates both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting#Qualitative_vs._quantitative_methods">qualitative and quantitative
methods</a>
is a comparatively simple idea. Basically, one needs to have only very few tools at ones
disposal to being ready to start forecasting:</p>

<ul>
<li>View of belief as probabilistic (perhaps with some bayesian epistemology)</li>
<li>Track records (grading results of forecasts using for example brier scores or log scores)</li>
<li>Probability theory (a concept of probabilities, and maybe some simple probability distributions)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier score</a> was invented
in 1950, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">Bayes' theorem</a>
was first described in 1763, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory">probability
theory</a> was properly
invented at the beginning of the 18th century.</p>

<p>However, attempting to use forecasting to seriously determine the
probability of future events, training &amp; selecting people for their
forecasting ability and creating procedures that incorporate both
intuition-based and model-based predictions have only been around since
the mid 1980's<!--TODO: citation needed-->, mostly popularized by the
work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehpilp_E._Tetlock">Philip Tetlock</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, forecasting has slowly but surely matured from "X is going
to happen because my intuition/divine revelation told me so" to "my
probability distribution on the outcome of this random variable is
an X distribution", or alternatively "I assign a probability of X%
to this event".</p>

<p>However, since this kind of forecasting is relatively recent, information
about the accuracy of long-range forecasting is basically non-existent:</p>

<p><!--TODO: quote the findings from the OpenPhil report here--></p>

<p>In this text, I will try to look at the accuracy of short-term and
mid-term forecasting, which may shine some light on the relation between
the range of forecasts and their accuracy in general. The range of a
forecast is defined as the length of the timespan between the forecast
and the resolution of the forecast. Keeping with the report by the Open
Philanthropy Project<!--TODO: link-->, I will define short-term forecasts
as forecasts with a range of less than a year, mid-range forecasts as
forecasts with a range between 1 and 10 years, and long-term forecasts
as forecasts with a range of more than 10 years.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for short- and mid-range forecasts, two easily accessible
sources of forecasts and their resolutions are available online: The
two forecasting websites <a href="https://predictionbook.com">PredictionBook</a>
and <a href="https://www.metaculus.com">Metaculus</a>.</p>

<p><!--
Make a point here that making forecasts is one of the best existing
practical method of rationality verification &amp; exercises:

Tetlock-style forecasting is "Worse is Better"
If we can't develop explicit numerical models, why
not train people in becoming good at estimating the future,
but this time with probabilistic estimates?
