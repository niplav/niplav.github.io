<!--TODO: Fermi estimates for all of these-->
<ul>
<li>Cookie warnings in the EU, caused by the GDPR
<ul>
<li>Civilizational cost Fermi estimate
<ul>
<li>1 warning per day, which takes 2 seconds to close, with ~400 mio. people use the internet regularly, for the 4 years since GDPR was instituted</li>
<li><code>$\frac{1 \text{ warning}}{\text{person} \cdot \text{day}} \cdot \frac{2 \text{ unskilled labor seconds}}{\text{warning}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ unskilled labor hour}}{3600 \text{ unskilled labor seconds}} \cdot \frac{365 \text{ days}}{\text{year}} \cdot 4 \text{ years} \cdot 4 \cdot 10^8 \text{ persons} \approx 3.25 \cdot 10^8 \text{ unskilled labor hours}$</code></li>
<li>Which at <code>$\frac{5€}{\text{unskilled labor hour}}$</code> is ~1.6 bio. €</li>
<li>Can the benefit compare to this?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gear sticks for manual gear shifting (which are much more common in the EU, I think)
<ul>
<li>Civilizational cost Fermi estimate
<ul>
<li>Let's assume that ~half of the population of Europe learned to drive with manual (manual might not have been available beforehand), which took them ~5 hours more on average.</li>
<li>That gives <code>$\frac{5 \text{ unskilled labour hours}}{\text{person}} \cdot 3 \cdot 10^8 \text{ persons}=1.5 \cdot 10^8 \text{ unskilled labour hours}$</code></li>
<li>At <code>$\frac{5€}{\text{unskilled labor hour}}$</code> this is ~7.5 bio. €</li>
<li>Although maybe this isn't a civiliational inadequacy (since there is not <em>really</em> an equilibrium we're caught in), or at least we're in the process of transitioning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/stick-shift-collector-cars.html">out of it</a>.</li>
<li>Disregarding
<ul>
<li>Any costs from increased numbers of crashes.</li>
<li>Increased crash probabilities from higher cognitive load.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Further relevant numbers
<ul>
<li>It seems like automatic cars <a href="https://20somethingfinance.com/manual-transmission-savings/">are now <em>more</em> fuel efficient than manual ones</a>, at ~$60 per 1000 kilometers.<!--TODO: maybe use http://www.fueleconomy.

<li>On the other hand, automatic gearshifting mechanisms <a href="https://www.fbfs.com/learning-center/automatic-vs-manual-cars-costs-to-consider">are far more expensive to repair</a>, at a cost of ~\$2k-\$4k, whereas manual transmission replacement costs ~\$1.5k-\$3k.</li>
<li>Additionally, <a href="https://20somethingfinance.com/manual-transmission-savings/">this page</a> states that manual cars are still ~\$1k cheaper than automatic ones.</li>
<li>The world produces about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_production#World_motor_vehicle_production">100 mio. cars per year</a>.</li>

<li>Non-velcro shoes</li>
<li>Courses at university are not 3blue1brown + Q&amp;A + extensive quizzes (or automated tutoring à la DARPA)</li>
<li>TSA security theater</li>
<li>A lot of terminology in mathematics, for example using "numerator"/"denominator" instead of "upper number"/"lower number" when talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction">fractions</a> (which would be vastly easier to understand/remember <em>and</em> in one case even has fewer syllables)</li>

<h3 id="Fragile_Tableware"><a class="hanchor" href="#Fragile_Tableware">Fragile Tableware</a></h3>
<p>Ceramic/porcelain plates and cups made of glass break easily, while the
æsthetics we have around them seem mostly path-dependent (and perhaps
even <em>caused</em> by their fragility, leftovers from a time where fragile
tableware signaled wealth).</p>
<p><strong>Cooling</strong>: Generally, porcelain plates have the advantage
that food placed on them cools less quickly. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_thermal_conductivities">states
that</a>
porcelain has a thermal conductivity of ~1.4 to 1.9
<code>$\frac{W}{K \cdot m}$</code> at ~400 Kelvin, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrex">pyrex
glass</a> variants have thermal
conductivities of 1-2 in the the range 273-373 Kelvin, while Aluminium
(a contender for a substance out of which to make plates, glasses &amp;
cups) has a thermal conductivity of ~100 <code>$\frac{W}{K \cdot m}$</code> at
273 Kelvin — which leads to faster cooling, and colder food is less
enjoyable to eat. However, we don't <em>have</em> to be stupid about this:
plastics lose heat even more slowly than porcelain (generally with
thermal conductivities &lt;1).</p>
<p><strong>Æsthetics</strong>: The other advantage of porcelain and glass is that they
just <em>look so much nicer</em>. I don't have any strong rejoinders here,
my æsthetics rejoice in knowing that I'm doing a thing that is more
economical—but I acknowledge that I'm in the minority there. The
only guidepost I can offer is to look at the price and then ask: "Are
the æsthetics worth this price?" If yes, go ahead! If not, I may have
pointed out something interesting.</p>
<p>Code for a slightly more complicated Fermi
estimate, (mis)using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming_language">probabilistic programming
language</a>
Turing.jl:</p>
<pre><code>    using Turing, Plots

    @model function ceramic_glass()
            people ~ Normal(8*10^9, 0.05)
            meals_per_day ~ truncated(Normal(2.5, 1), lower=0)
            proportion_tableware_users ~ Beta(5, 2.5) # Mean ⅔
            breakage_per_meal ~ Beta(1.5, 1000) # Mean ~0.0015
            cost_per_tableware ~ truncated(Normal(2, 0.5), lower=0) # In dollars
    end

    chains = sample(ceramic_glass(), IS(), 10000)
    sampled=get(chains, [:people, :meals_per_day, :proportion_tableware_users, :breakage_per_meal, :cost_per_tableware])
    total_cost_per_day=sampled[:people] .* sampled[:meals_per_day] .* sampled[:proportion_tableware_users] .* sampled[:breakage_per_meal] .* sampled[:cost_per_tableware]
    mean(total_cost_per_day)
    4.00195809996674e7
    gui(histogram(total_cost_per_day, label="samples", xlabel="cost", ylabel="number of samples"))
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/civilizational_inadequacies/cost_histogram.png"/></p>
<p>I'm aware that this code is ugly, and I'll fix it<!--TODO: look at how
to do this properly in Turing, maybe download documentation-->.</p>
<p>Note that this code only estimates the costs of fragile tableware, and
makes no statements about the costs of e.g. switching to alternative
materials.</p>
