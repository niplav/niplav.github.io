<h3 id="NonVelcro_Shoes"><a class="hanchor" href="#NonVelcro_Shoes">Non-Velcro Shoes</a></h3>
<p>Velcro shoes are faster to close/open than shoes with shoelaces (I'd
guess ~4 seconds vs. 20 seconds for closing), but velcro is slightly
more expensive to produce (my gut guess is that it's not much, maybe a
dollar more?) and current aesthetic sensibilities speak against it.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://squigglehub.org/models/niplav/shoelaces">a squiggle model</a>
based on an AI-generated model, I estimate that the annual benefit
of switching to velcro shoes would be worth \$80B in expectation
(5th/50th/95th percentile: \$-34B, \$66B, \$260B), assuming that
aesthetic costs are on average \$10/year, and normally distributed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/inadequacies/net_benefit.png"/></p>
<p>A breakdown of the different types of costs reveals that manufacturing
costs are mostly negligible:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/inadequacies/different_costs.png"/></p>
<p>Aesthetic costs exceeding $25/person-year render the mean &amp; median
value of switching to velcro negative. My hunch is that if humanity <em>did</em>
switch, velcro shoes would become at least aesthetically neutral within
a decade<sub>45%</sub>, plausibly being regarded as coller/more beautiful
than shoes with shoelaces<sub>30%</sub>.</p>
<p>Relevant further question: Does velcro break more quickly/easily?</p>
<h3 id="Fragile_Tableware"><a class="hanchor" href="#Fragile_Tableware">Fragile Tableware</a></h3>
<p>Ceramic/porcelain plates and cups made of glass break easily, while the
æsthetics we have around them seem mostly path-dependent (and perhaps
even <em>caused</em> by their fragility, leftovers from a time where fragile
tableware signaled wealth).</p>
<p><strong>Cooling</strong>: Generally, porcelain plates have the advantage
that food placed on them cools less quickly. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_thermal_conductivities">states
that</a>
porcelain has a thermal conductivity of ~1.4 to 1.9
<code>$\frac{W}{K \cdot m}$</code> at ~400 Kelvin, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrex">pyrex
glass</a> variants have thermal
conductivities of 1-2 in the the range 273-373 Kelvin, while Aluminium
(a contender for a substance out of which to make plates, glasses &amp;
cups) has a thermal conductivity of ~100 <code>$\frac{W}{K \cdot m}$</code> at
273 Kelvin — which leads to faster cooling, and colder food is less
enjoyable to eat. However, we don't <em>have</em> to be stupid about this:
plastics lose heat even more slowly than porcelain (generally with
thermal conductivities &lt;1).</p>
<p><strong>Æsthetics</strong>: The other advantage of porcelain and glass is that they
just <em>look so much nicer</em>. I don't have any strong rejoinders here,
my æsthetics rejoice in knowing that I'm doing a thing that is more
economical—but I acknowledge that I'm in the minority there. The
only guidepost I can offer is to look at the price and then ask: "Are
the æsthetics worth this price?" If yes, go ahead! If not, I may have
pointed out something interesting.</p>
<p>Code for a slightly more complicated Fermi
estimate, (mis)using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming_language">probabilistic programming
language</a>
Turing.jl:</p>
<pre><code>    using Turing, Plots

    @model function ceramic_glass()
            people ~ Normal(8*10^9, 0.05)
            meals_per_day ~ truncated(Normal(2.5, 1), lower=0)
            proportion_tableware_users ~ Beta(5, 2.5) # Mean ⅔
            breakage_per_meal ~ Beta(1.5, 1000) # Mean ~0.0015
            cost_per_tableware ~ truncated(Normal(2, 0.5), lower=0) # In dollars
    end

    chains = sample(ceramic_glass(), IS(), 10000)
    sampled=get(chains, [:people, :meals_per_day, :proportion_tableware_users, :breakage_per_meal, :cost_per_tableware])
    total_cost_per_day=sampled[:people] .* sampled[:meals_per_day] .* sampled[:proportion_tableware_users] .* sampled[:breakage_per_meal] .* sampled[:cost_per_tableware]

<p>This is a clear case of where <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/t6FA9kGsJsEQMDExt/what-is-estim%0Aational-programming-squiggle-in-context">estimational
programming</a>
has a strong advantage over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming">probabilistic
programming</a>.</p>
<p>Note that this code only estimates the costs of fragile tableware, and
makes no statements about the costs of e.g. switching to alternative
materials.</p>
<h2 id="None"><a class="hanchor" href="#None">Appendix A: Civilizational <em>Adequacies</em></a></h2>
<p>I use the term "civilizational adequacy" in a very strict sense
here: Areas where our world surprisingly overperforms, implementing
policies or having institutions that, given one were to observe
them, would indicate our civiliation being adequate in many other
dimensions too. "Mundane" but still impressive infrastructure doesn't
count, even though it's really good. See also <a href="https://croissanthology.com/adequate.html">Croissanthology
