<p>Many daygamers follow the <a href="https://tddaygame.com/london-daygame-model/">London Daygame
Model</a> which is fairly
linear and based on approaches that last 5-10 minutes each.</p>
<p>Is this method of daygame worth it, and if yes, how much should one
be doing?</p>
<p>In this text, I first review existing texts on the topic and find them
lacking in several ways. I then present a simple and general model for
the value of doing a number of daygame approaches, and find that it
recommends doing 484 approaches with a value of \$969 in the optimum. I
then extend the model to more subjective and hard to measure factors
such as positive side effects, effects of daygame on mood and similar
other factors, and estimate that the optimal number of approaches is 1024
(power of two not indended, but appreciated), at a value of \$2110.</p>
<p>The models presented don't consider externalities, be they positive or
negative. That is the subject of a different debate.</p>

2012</a>,
he focuses on nightgame in bars and clubs and concludes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cost for Sex [from prostitution]: \$300<br/>
Cost for sex [from game]: \$460 (\$200 is you enjoy clubbing, gaming,
and dating for their own sake)<br/>
[…]<br/>
For casual sex, a mid-range prostitute is cheaper than game.
On the other hand, most of game’s costs are in the form of time
opportunity costs, so if you have a lot of free time and little money
or you enjoy the activities of clubbing, game, or dating even without
the promise of sex, then game might be a better deal.
In addition, the higher your average wage, the more expensive game
becomes relative to prostitution, as the opportunity costs of game
increase the more potential earning you sacrifice.
Conclusion: For obtaining casual sex, game is the better option if you
are paid low wages and have free time or if you enjoy game and related
activities. Prostitution is the better option if you are middle-class,
don’t have the free time, or dislike engaging in game.</p>

<p>(Inconsistent capitalization is in the original text)</p>
<p>However, his analysis doesn't take daygame into account (he mentions
it at the end). Daygame seems to me to be a much better option (not
just for people who don't like nightclubs): it's healthy due to moving
around a lot outside, getting drunk is mostly not an option, it doesn't
mess up the sleep schedule, one doesn't have to pay to get into clubs,
and it can be combined with sightseeing in foreign cities.</p>
<p>He also doesn't consider positive side-effects from game (such as
increased confidence), negative side-effects from prostitution (such as
addiction<!--TODO: link-->), and diminishing
returns in his analysis.</p>

<p>In daygame-lingo, the word "ratio" usually refers to the ratio between
approaches and contact information (such as phone numbers)/dates/women
slept with (colloquially "lays"). In this text, I'm interested in the
approach-to-date ratio (here the ratio of first dates to approaches)
and the approach-to-lay ratio.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>30 approaches will get me between 10 - 15 phone numbers.<br/>
Half of these phone numbers will flake leaving me messaging around 5 -
8 girls.<br/>
I will get half of these girls out on dates (between 2 - 4) and sleep
with 1 or 2.<br/>
These are realistic stats, this is cold approach, cold approach
is tough.</p>

<p>James Tusk is a very good looking daygame coach, so these numbers are
quite high.</p>
<p><a href="https://daygamersbible.wordpress.com/2018/05/23/daygame-statistics-and-what-they-tell-your-daygame/" title="Daygame Statistics and What They Tell About Your Daygame">daygamersbible

proclaims
16.9% numbers/approaches, 22.4% dates/numbers and 37.1% lays/dates
(that would be <code>$0.169 \cdot 0.224=0.0378$</code> dates per approach, and
<code>$0.169 \cdot 0.224*0.371=0.0140$</code> lays per approach).</p>
<p>Tom Torero presents his experiences with daygame ratios in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WzKWHvDOOQ">this video</a>
<a href="./vid/daygame_cost_benefit/realistic_daygame_expectations.webm">(a)</a>.
He claims that a beginner will on average get a lay out of a hundred
approaches, an intermediate one out of fifty, and an advanced daygamer
one lay out of thirty. He doesn't specify how much practice makes
a beginner/intermediate/advanced daygamer.</p>
<p>The numbers for the approach-to-lay ratios were 1 in 100 for beginners,
1 in 50 for intermediate daygamers and 1 in 30 for experts.</p>
<h3 id="Empirical_Data_for_Ratios"><a class="hanchor" href="#Empirical_Data_for_Ratios">Empirical Data for Ratios</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately, some daygamers are often very diligent in keeping track
records of their ratios and even publish them.</p>
<p>Here, I collect cumulative date and lay ratios from several blogs. I
don't count idates as dates, because I'm not sure whether daygamers
usually pay for them or not.</p>
<p>Note that these numbers are just stats some guys wrote on the internet,
usual qualifiers about the accuracy of these values apply.</p>
<h4 id="Roy_Walker"><a class="hanchor" href="#Roy_Walker">Roy Walker</a></h4>
<p>I am also not sure whether at some points "dates" was all dates combined,
and later was split into "first date", "second date" etc. For simplicity I
assume that in the beginning, "dates" simply referred to "first date". It
still seems to be coherent.</p>

<h3 id="Estimating_Parameters"><a class="hanchor" href="#Estimating_Parameters">Estimating Parameters</a></h3>
<p>I will assume that this is comparatively over-optimistic,
and assume that the date-to-lay ratio converges towards 1 in
30 on the scale of thousands of approaches in the form of an
<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2" title="S-Curves for Trend Forecasting">S-curve</a>.
The other parameters are estimated using
<a href="./notes.html#None"><code>scipy.optimize.curve_fit</code></a> with data from Roy Walker,
Mr. Wolfe and Thomas Crown, since we have information from the start.</p>
<h4 id="Lays"><a class="hanchor" href="#Lays">Lays</a></h4>
<p>First we collect the relevant information in a processable form (removing
the first datapoint from Mr. Wolfe because it confuses <code>curve_fit</code>):</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
import scipy.optimize as spo
rwlay=np.array([[511, 5],[901, 10],[977, 10],[1060, 11],[1143, 13],[1216, 14],[1380, 16],[1448, 18],[1557, 19],[1990, 27],[2063, 27],[2130, 27],[2230, 27],[2373, 31],[2540, 35],[2876, 44],[3442, 62],[3567, 63],[3991, 83],[4092, 84]])
tclay=np.array([[208, 2],[1638, 20],[2453, 34],[3036, 45]])
wlay=np.array([[39, 1],[200, 2],[396, 3],[584, 4],[619, 5],[678, 6],[746, 7],[825, 8],[961, 9],[1086, 9],[1122, 9],[1174, 10],[1220, 11],[1267, 11],[1317, 12],[1322, 12]])
def ratio_of(data):
    return data.T[1]/data.T[0]
ratios=np.concatenate([ratio_of(rwlay), ratio_of(tclay), ratio_of(wlay)])
approaches=np.concatenate([rwlay.T[0], tclay.T[0], wlay.T[0]])
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can estimate the parameters:</p>
<pre><code>def shrunk_logistic(x, slope, intercept, ceiling):
    return ceiling*1/(1+np.exp(slope*x+intercept))
ratio_fit=spo.curve_fit(shrunk_logistic, approaches, ratios, bounds=([-np.inf, 0, 0], [1, np.inf, 0.033]))
</code></pre>
<p>These numbers are of course heavily dependant on all kinds of factors:
attractiveness, speed of learning, effort exerted in daygame, logistics
and much much more.</p>
<h4 id="Dates"><a class="hanchor" href="#Dates">Dates</a></h4>
<p>I then repeat the same procedure for dates, collecting the date ratio
data for Walker, Wolfe &amp; Crown:</p>
<pre><code>rwdate=np.array([[511, 19,], [901, 38,], [977, 38,], [1060, 40,], [1143, 46,], [1216, 48,], [1380, 58,], [1448, 63,], [1557, 64,], [1990, 81,], [2063, 81,], [2130, 84,], [2230, 85,], [2373, 91,], [2540, 97,], [2876, 126,], [3442, 165,], [3567, 170,], [3991, 200,], [4092, 202]])
tcdate=np.array([[208, 12], [1638, 79], [2453, 116]])
wdate=np.array([[445, 11,], [593, 12,], [700, 14,], [783, 15,], [858, 19,], [925, 23,], [1000, 32,], [1086, 32,], [1122, 32,], [1174, 35,], [1220, 37,], [1267, 37,], [1317, 39,], [1322, 39,]])

date_ratios=np.concatenate([ratio_of(rwdate), ratio_of(tcdate), ratio_of(wdate)])
approaches=np.concatenate([rwdate.T[0], tcdate.T[0], wdate.T[0]])
</code></pre>
<p>This time I assume that at best one goes on a date with 1 in 14 women
approached:</p>
<pre><code>date_ratio_fit=spo.curve_fit(shrunk_logistic, approaches, date_ratios, bounds=([-np.inf, 0, 0], [1, np.inf, 0.07]))
date_slope, date_intercept, date_ceiling=date_ratio_fit[0]
</code></pre>
<p>The Klong code describing the date- and lay- ratios is then as follows:</p>
<pre><code>layceil::0.032999999999999995
layslope::-0.00032469342601662376
layintercept::1.0921062524727312

<p>I will assume that most daygamers will do around 4 approaches an hour
(less in the beginning, with approach anxiety, but more later), with 15
minutes for one approach.</p>
<p>The opportunity cost of daygame is unclear—what would one be doing
instead? One could dream of daygamers instead cultivating friendships,
learning languages or making music or meditating, and while that could
certainly sometimes be the case, a lot of that time would also be spent
on mindlessly browsing the internet, watching netflix or doing other
things that aren't terribly fulfilling or valuable. Economists often
assume that the opportunity cost of an activity to be the money one
could have earned during that time, so I'll just go with that.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://programs.clearerthinking.org/what_is_your_time_really_worth_to_you.html">Clearer Thinking
tool</a>
for the value of my time returns 20€/hour:</p>
<pre><code>oppcost::20
</code></pre>
<p>Daygamers who could earn more with their day job might want to adjust
this number upwards.</p>
<h5 id="Skepticism"><a class="hanchor" href="#Skepticism">Skepticism</a></h5>
<p>I am skeptical that the opportunity cost should be ones wage: an
additional hour spent working might be net negative, even with taking wage
into account (working hours have diminishing and at some point negative
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility">marginal utility</a>
because of exhaustion).</p>
<p>It may be that daygame only replaces <em>productive</em> personal time, that
the energy exerted in daygame misses in other productive activities,
while the amount spent on downtime &amp; unfulfilling stuff stays constant.</p>
<p>But such things are difficult to quantify, so I'll stick with the
opportunity cost.</p>
<!--
TODO: move to "other benefits"
Furthermore, the physical activity while doing daygame is broadly
good: most people probably don't spend enough time outside walking
around (reducing [Vitamin D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin-D)
deficiency), and interacting with other people.

<p>He reports 76 first dates, 27 second dates, 11 third dates and 5 fourth
dates. This means that he went on 5 dates with 4 women, on 3 dates with
<code>$11-5=6$</code> women, and so forth. This means that the average number of dates he
went on per first date was
<code>$\frac{5\cdot 4+(11-5)\cdot 3+(27-11)\cdot 2+(76-27)}{76} \approx 1.566$</code>
– quite lower than the 3 assumed by <a href="https://freenortherner.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/economic-analysis-of-casual-sex-prostitution-vs-game/" title="Economic Analysis of Casual Sex – Prostitution vs Game">Free Northerner

<p>He reports 76 first dates, 21 second dates, 13 third
dates, 6 fourth dates and 1 fifth date. This results in
<code>$\frac{(1\cdot 5+(6-1)\cdot 4+(13-6)\cdot 3+(21-13)\cdot 2+(76-21))}{76} \approx 1.54$</code>
dates per lay, again smaller.</p>
<p>Similarly, Thomas Crown reports <a href="https://thomascrownpua.wordpress.com/2016-17/" title="2016/17 Statistics">1.4 dates on average for a lay in
his first year</a>
and <a href="https://thomascrownpua.wordpress.com/2018-statistics/" title="2018 Statistics">1.1 for his
second</a>.</p>
<p>I will assume 1.7 dates on average lasting 3.5h each, because the numbers

<pre><code>datelen::3.5
avgdates::1.7
</code></pre>
<h5 id="Paying_for_Dates"><a class="hanchor" href="#Paying_for_Dates">Paying for Dates</a></h5>
<p>On dates, one usually needs to pay for drinks, food, and perhaps a taxi,
there doesn't seem to be much information about the exact costs out
there. I will assume \$20 for a date.</p>
<pre><code>datecost::20
</code></pre>
<h4 id="Calculating_the_Cost"><a class="hanchor" href="#Calculating_the_Cost">Calculating the Cost</a></h4>
<p>The cost of daygame is the sum of the opportunity cost from approaching,
the opportunity cost of dates and the direct cost of paying for dates:</p>
<pre><code>cost::{(oppcost*x%apprperhour)+(dateratio(x)*datecost*avgdates*x)+dateratio(x)*datelen*avgdates*oppcost}
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting function is linear on the number of approaches:</p>

<h3 id="Benefit"><a class="hanchor" href="#Benefit">Benefit</a></h3>
<p>The thing providing most of the value from daygame is the sex with
different women. Sex is not a homogenous commodity, but instead has a
wildly differing value, depending on the attractiveness of the partner
and their skill at sex. Nethertheless I will assume that the value of
sex averages out to the price of prostitution.</p>
<p>I will consider two different components of the value: the value of
the sex itself (as compared to prostitution) and the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/star-wars-battlefront-ii-unlockable-heroes-controversy">sense of pride and
accomplishment</a>
(knowing that one is developing ones skills in daygame, while prostitution
is often accompanied with shame<!--TODO: source-->).</p>
<h4 id="Value_of_the_Sex_Itself"><a class="hanchor" href="#Value_of_the_Sex_Itself">Value of the Sex Itself</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>According to this intro to escorting guide on a business blog
for escorts (I guess escorts need business advice too; the weird
things you find on the internet) costs about $250-500/hr depending
on the city.</p>

<!--TODO: find own sources-->
<p>This leaves us with ~\$400 per hour of prostitution, but I want to flag
that the cost of prostitution is highly dependent on the attractiveness
of the escort, with prices in the thousands of dollars for particularly
beautiful women—but realistically I don't expect to find data on the
beauty of women that men sleep with through daygame compared to the
beauty of escorts.</p>
<p>I will assume that one sex session lasts one hour and that the average
daygamer sleeps with the same woman 4 times (some women become regulars
or long-term partners, even if the overwhelming majority is only a
one-night stand).</p>
<p>And I will assume that the diminishing returns on sex with the same
partner <em>is</em> logarithmic, because for men, having sex multiple times with
the same woman carries little <em>evolutionary</em> advantage except perhaps for
competition with other mens sperm.</p>
<!--TODO: this is not true? Finding a good match, linear as one drives
down the probability of not having fathered children, etc-->
<p>So we can calculate that the value of sleeping with one woman is</p>
<pre><code>    .l("math")
    350*log(2;4)
700.0
</code></pre>
<!--TODO: what if we tried to maximize the utility from sleeping with a
woman some number of times? Especially since sleeping with more beautiful
women is a higher initial return-->
<h5 id="Diminishing_Returns_on_Sex_Partners"><a class="hanchor" href="#Diminishing_Returns_on_Sex_Partners">Diminishing Returns on Sex Partners</a></h5>
<p>I will also assume that the dimimishing returns on sex with different
partners are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-root">radical</a>,
with an exponent of <code>$\frac{199}{200}$</code>.</p>
<p>I have not found any people discussing this and <a href="#Appendix_D_Some_Questions_About_the_Value_of_Offspring">other
questions</a>,
and there is probably a high variance in these numbers depending on
the daygamer.</p>
<p>My intuition is that it should be linear, which stems from the handwavey
evolutionary argument that men should value additional offspring with
randomly selected women with a constant marginal return, since more
diverse offspring from a basically infinite population of mating partners
result (in expectation) in linearly more grandchildren.</p>
<p><em>If</em> I assume it's linear, then the model just straight up gives
astronomical values for doing daygame. Like, it's no question <em>at all</em>
whether one should do daygame, and one should basically never stop
doing it.</p>
<p>If you believe that there are linear returns to the number of sex
partners, then you want to do daygame, unless you value sex very little.
<!--TODO: maybe have *another* version of the model?--></p>
<p>But, in practice, many men doing pick-up lose the motivation after some
number of lays, their notch hyena<!--TODO: link--> satisfied, so there
must be <em>some</em> diminishing returns here. But logarithmic returns are
quite punishing, and don't seem to capture the underlying dynamic very
well—hence the compromise with radical diminishing returns with a
"large" (i.e. very slowly diminishing) exponent. That way, it's not
as crazy as non-diminishing returns, but still captures some of the
real-world dynamics and theoretical intuitions.</p>
<pre><code>partnerexp::199%200
</code></pre>
<h4 id="A_Sense_of_Pride_and_Accomplishment"><a class="hanchor" href="#A_Sense_of_Pride_and_Accomplishment">A Sense of Pride and Accomplishment</a></h4>
<p>I will assume that the sense of pride and accomplishment is ~\$400 for
the first lay. I am making this number up, since I'm lacking any data
on this. (If one believes this to be too much, I'll remind the reader
that men sometimes pay thousands of dollars for pick-up coaching and
bootcamps, which very far from guarantee any sex.)</p>
<p>To wrap it up, one can conclude that the value of the first lay is</p>
<pre><code>    prostcost::350
    prideval::400
    laynum::4
    firstlayval::prideval+prostcost*log(2;laynum)
1000.0
</code></pre>
<p>As said, I assume that the marginal returns on additional sex partners are
radical—except for the sense of pride and accomplishment, which very
much disappears over time. I'll assume it's logarithmic.</p>
<h4 id="Calculating_the_Benefit"><a class="hanchor" href="#Calculating_the_Benefit">Calculating the Benefit</a></h4>
<p>The benefit from sex can be calculated by summing the expected sense of
pride and accomplishment and the expected value from having sex. Note
that this number is cumulative, as it considers the benefit of all lays
up for <code>x</code> approaches:</p>
<pre><code>firstlayat::118

pridevals::{prideval*log(2;x+1)*layratio(x)*x}
pridemult::prideval%log(2;pridevals(firstlayat)) :"For normalization, so that the first lay is actually worth as much"
discpridevals::{pridemult*log(2;pridevals(x))}

layvals::{prostcost*log(2;laynum)*layratio(x)*x}
laymult::prostcost%layvals(firstlayat)^partnerexp :"same here"
disclayvals::{(laymult*layvals(x))^partnerexp}
</code></pre>
<p>This looks like this for up to 5000 approaches:</p>
<pre><code>.l("./load.kg")

.l("nplot")

grid([0],maxappr,[1000];[0 50000 2000])
xtitle("Approaches")
ytitle("Cumulative dollar value of lays")
plot(layvals)
draw()
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="Value of lays for a given number of approaches, cumulatively" src="./img/daygame_cost_benefit/layvals.png" title="Value of lays for a given number of approaches, cumulatively. It is a graph growing approximately by the number of approaches to the power of 199/200."/></p>
<p>Then the total benefit is the discounted pride values and the discounted
value of sex:</p>
<pre><code>benefit::{discpridevals(x)+disclayvals(x)}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="Value"><a class="hanchor" href="#Value">Value</a></h3>
<p>To now calculate the optimal amount of daygame, one simply calculates
the difference between cumulative benefit and cumulative cost for all
possible number of approaches up to the maximum possible number (in this
case 5000, which is a common number for expert daygamers) and chooses the maximum:</p>
<pre><code>    maxappr::5000
    vals::{benefit(x)-cost(x)}'1+!maxappr
    optim::*&gt;vals
4999
    optimben::vals@*&gt;vals
10190.4271226371274
</code></pre>
<p>So one can conclude that 5000 approaches (i.e., as many as possible)
are optimal under these assumptions, with a value of \$10k.</p>
<p>This can be visualized as well:</p>
<pre><code>.l("nplot")

.l("./res.kg")

<h2 id="A_Slightly_More_Complex_Model"><a class="hanchor" href="#A_Slightly_More_Complex_Model">A Slightly More Complex Model</a></h2>
<p>Of course one might answer that the simple model fails to capture much
of the subtlety of the situation: Proponents of daygame might mention
positive psychological side-effects such as increased self-confidence
and resilience to rejection. Opponents of daygame could point at direct
financial expenditures (such as possibly having to buy new clothes,
renting an apartment that is closer to good places for daygame),
and also possible social and psychological costs (scars from constant
rejection and mockery from being found out to be a pick-up "artist"),
if they ever stopped moaning about how they disapprove of daygame.</p>
<p>These influences are of course much harder to quantify, and the numbers
presented here are mostly guesswork. As I get to know more daygamers
and do more daygame myself, I intend to update and refine this model
to better reflect reality.</p>
<p>Note that this slightly more complex model adds to the previous, simpler
model. Previously assumed costs and benefits are not altered.</p>
<h3 id="Additional_Benefits"><a class="hanchor" href="#Additional_Benefits">Additional Benefits</a></h3>
<p>Besides sex, the additional benefits of daygame can be separated into two
broad categories: Increases in subjective well-being (from cultivating
a skill that requires effort and practice), and positive side effects
such as increased salary resulting from a higher willingness to negotiate
ones salary and search for other jobs.</p>
<!--TODO: Find a better partner benefit-->
<h4 id="Positive_Side_Effects"><a class="hanchor" href="#Positive_Side_Effects">Positive Side Effects</a></h4>
<p>Let's assume one does 1000 daygame approaches per year.
Let's then assume that doing 1000 daygame approaches increases ones
expected salary by 0.5% in the first year, with then logarithmic increases
for each additional year, for 10 years.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage">parity purchasing power average annual
wage</a>
in the US was \$60k in 2017, but many industrialized countries are lower.
I'll assume that the average annual wage for a daygamer is \$40k, just
to be safe.</p>
<p>The code for calculating the monetary value of the positive side-effects of
doing x daygame approaches then is</p>
<pre><code>annsal::40000
yearsben::10
increase::0.005
apppy::1000
sideeff::{yearsben*increase*annsal*ln(1+x%apppy)}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="Mental_Benefit"><a class="hanchor" href="#Mental_Benefit">Mental Benefit</a></h4>
<p>This one is tricky, especially for somebody who has never done any
daygame approaches. Many daygamers seem to highly enjoy what they
do, but that is probably mostly due to selection bias.
I'll mostly rely on my personal experience and on this very biased sample
set here, so take this with a grain of salt. That said, I haven't read
any reports describing that the author stopped doing daygame due to
stress or uncontrollable anxiety, although people who would do that
would probably never start doing daygame in the first place.</p>
<p>To get to the point, I model the mental effects of daygame to be negative
in the beginning (increased anxiety, self-doubt, and insecurity),
and positive effects such as playful enjoyment, flow-states and
extraverted enthusiasm setting after in after an initial hump. These
positive states become less strong over time because of getting used
to pickup. Specifically, the negative effects peak at ~80 approaches
(with -\$500), and break even after ~300. The cumulative value approaches
\$1900 over thousands of approaches.</p>
<p>To model this, I abuse a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution">log-normal
distribution</a>
to represent the value over time:</p>
<pre><code>mental::{(10000*(ln.pdf((x*0.005)+0.5;1;1)))-1900}

<h3 id="Additional_Costs"><a class="hanchor" href="#Additional_Costs">Additional Costs</a></h3>
<h4 id="Expenditures"><a class="hanchor" href="#Expenditures">Expenditures</a></h4>
<p>Besides the cost for dates &amp; opportunity costs, doing daygame might carry
a great amount of various expenditures: some daygamers move to appartments
that are closer to the centers of cities &amp; are more expensive, there may
be some costs from upgrading ones wardrobe, buying condoms and possibly
sex toys<!--TODO: Red Quest/KYIL post about sex toys-->.</p>
<p>In economics, costs are often divided into fixed costs (costs that are
not dependent on the amount of goods produced, in this case approaches
made) and variable costs (costs that are related to the amount of goods
produced).</p>
<p>Making the distinction between fixed costs and variable costs is sometimes
a bit tricky; similar in this case. Is buying new clothes a fixed or a
variable cost? Clothes wear down over time, and need to be bought again,
but the difference doing daygame makes in wearing down clothes is minor
at best. Also, some costs will depend on the time in ones life doing
daygame, but not on the amount of daygame: Doing daygame for 10 years,
but only with 100 approaches a year, will have different fixed costs
from doing it for a year, but 1000 approaches in that year. In making
the distinction between what counts as a fixed cost in this case and
what counts as a variable cost, I will mostly go with my gut feeling.</p>
<p>Note that it is also important to consider the counterfactual case:
Would these expenditures be made if the person wasn't doing daygame?</p>
<h5 id="Fixed_Costs"><a class="hanchor" href="#Fixed_Costs">Fixed Costs</a></h5>
<p>I assume that the fixed costs for doing any daygame at all are \$500:</p>
<pre><code>fixcost::500
</code></pre>
<!--
To possible fixed costs I'd count the following:

* Logistics (higher rent from living closer to the city center)
* Sex toys
* Clothes (shoes, leather jacket etc.)
* Accessories (bracelets, beads, tattoos)
* Hygiene (better haircuts, marginal other improvements)
* Contacts (instead of glasses)
* Fitness (gym membership, buying weights)

Of course, not every daygamer pays for all of these.

Some of the above are dependent on the duration of the time in ones
life one spends with daygame. Having better logistics is a good example:
one can procrastinate daygaming and still be paying the higher rent for
better logistics.

Also time-dependent is better hygiene (I assume mostly marginal
improvements such as getting better haircuts, buying a bit more mouthwash
& floss and shaving a bit more often) and fitness (at least the fee for
gym memberships, weights don't need to be replaced that often).

For time-dependent costs, I assume that the daygamer is very committed,
and does 1000 approaches per year.

###### Logistics
-->
<!--TODO: find some examples for sources-->
<!--
I (without any research) assume that a daygamer will pay \\$200 more per
year for logistics.

It seems to be relatively common for daygamers to move because of daygame,
I'll assume that 30% of them will do it.

###### Sex Toys
-->
<!--Find sources for average vibrator cost-->
<!--
I assume the daygamer counterfactually buys one vibrator (those who
buy more probably would also have bought sex toys in the counterfactual
case where they weren't doing daygame). A vibrator seems to cost ~\\$30
on average.

Although buying sex toys has
been recommended by for example [The Red Quest
2019](https://theredquest.wordpress.com/2019/03/13/tell-your-girl-to-use-a-vibrator-during-sex-and-other-bedroom-tips/ "Tell your girl to use a vibrator during sex, and other bedroom tips and sex skills for guys"),
I haven't heard much discussion of this, and therefore assume that only
10% of daygamers will buy any kind of sex toys.

###### Clothes
-->
<!--TODO: find some sources/discussion?-->
<!--
Many daygamers seem to buy less flashy clothes, sometimes of higher
quality. I'm unsure how much these clothes introduce additional costs
and how much they just displace buying normal clothes. I'll pretty much
baselessly assume that the cost overhead is \\$80.

This seems like something many daygamers do, I'll assume 80%.

<h5 id="Variable_Costs"><a class="hanchor" href="#Variable_Costs">Variable Costs</a></h5>

* Condoms
* Transportation (money for gas, public transport)

<h4 id="Social_Costs_from_Being_Found_Out"><a class="hanchor" href="#Social_Costs_from_Being_Found_Out">Social Costs from Being Found Out</a></h4>
<p>For some people doing daygame, being found out as a daygamer can have
negative consequences: Loosing friends, being publicly shamed, or even
having negative effects in the workplace. For this reason (and probably
also as a precautionary measure), many daygamers publish their writing
online anonymously.</p>
<p>But doing daygame can also have negative side-effects even if one doesn't
write about it online: Acquantainces could see one doing daygame and
tell it around in parts of ones social circle, leading to ostracisation
or financial consequences.</p>
<p>On the other hand, being discovered probably doesn't propagate through
ones whole social circle, and often probably has very small effects.</p>
<p>I model this as having a certain probability of being discovered as
a daygamer for every approach. Being found out more than once has
logarithmically increasing costs with the number of being found out.</p>
<p>I'll (somewhat arbitrarily) set the cost of first being found at \$500,
and the probability of being found out at any approach to 0.1%.</p>
<p>The probability of being discovered <code>n</code> times with
<code>x</code> approaches can be calculated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial
distribution</a>.</p>
<p>To make the code run faster, only the scenarios with a cost of more than
\$0.01 are being considered.</p>

<p>I have presented both a simple and a more complicated cost-benefit
analysis for daygame. Both conclude that daygame is worth it, at around
500-1000 approaches, but the value is not enormous, with only a \$1-2k,
and decreases rapidly with less lenient assumptions.</p>
<p>I tentatively conclude that daygame may be worth it, but
it's definitely not a surefire positive deal. Sign up for

<p>A cost-benefit analysis of daygame contains some questions that
are not obvious to answer, but some of which feel tractable from a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_Genetics">population-genetics</a>
perspective:</p>
<ol>
<li>If one has sex as the result of daygame, how long does one have sex?</li>
<li>How often do daygamers sleep with the women they have seduced?</li>
<li>How strong are the diminishing returns to sex with different partners?
<ol>
<li>Or, in more general terms:</li>
<li>For a male animal, what is the function that describes the marginal value of mating once with a female randomly selected from the fertile population? I have the feeling that I would be able to answer this if I new more population genetics.</li>
<li>For example, a male animal should be willing to die for the expectation of &gt;2 offspring with a randomly selected female. But the chance of fathering a child with a random woman depends on the time of the woman's period, her age &amp;c.</li>
<li>One could then take ones life-time discounted estimated earning potential, calculate the expected value over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_rate#Pregnancy_rate_for_sexual_intercourse">pregnancy rate for sexual intercourse</a> given the age of the woman and the man, and multiply these together.</li>
<li>It's unclear to me whether there should be any effect of diminishing returns at all in the number of partners slept with, except perhaps through the fact that the population is not infinitely big and therefore the number of offspring with different partners' genes declines. But given that the world population is in the billions, we might just as well treat it as infinite.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>And how strong are the diminishing returns to sex with the same partner?
<ol>
<li>This could be investigated in the same way as the question above.</li>
