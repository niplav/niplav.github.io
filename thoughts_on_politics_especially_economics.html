<h1>Thoughts on Politics, Especially Economics</h1>

<h2>Before I Get to the Object-Level Stuff</h2>

<p>What can be done before talking about object-level policies.</p>

<h3>Improve Political Epistemology</h3>

<p>Forecasting, track records, public rationality.</p>

<h3>Copy What Successful Countries are Doing</h3>

<h3>This Text Is About Doing Even Better (Maybe)</h3>

<h2>What Politics Is For</h2>

<p>Maximize aggregate preferences of humans currently living in the country
(as citizens).</p>

<p>Not (although that would be nice) The One True Good Consequentialism,
or Our Best Guess of Morality With Moral Uncertainty, since you can't
coordinate around that.</p>

<h3>This Is Not An Adequate View!</h3>

<p>I know. People don't really have stable, coherent preferences.</p>

<!--TODO: The case against economic values in the brain.-->

<p>However, it's the best model I know of.</p>

<p>How deep does this instability &amp; incoherence go?</p>

<p><a href="./doc/population_ethics_impossible/an_impossibility_theorem_for_welfarist_axiologies_arrhenius_2000.pdf">Arrhenius
2000</a>
gives one answer.</p>

<h3>Then How Do We Find These Preferences?</h3>

<p>Ask people. Maybe quadratic voting on different metrics.</p>

<h2>Caveat: Empirical Versus Theoretical Knowledge About Politics/Economics</h2>

<h3>Biases More Prevalent on the Object Level, Right?</h3>

<h3>A Lot of Empirical Knowledge About Politics Might Not Be Useful</h3>

<p>More just signals.</p>

<h3>How To Evaluate?</h3>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<h3>Economic Progress is Usually Good</h3>

<h4>How Much Do People Value Economic Progress?</h4>

<h4>How Much Would People Value Economic Progress if They Knew More?</h4>

<h4>How Good Is Moral Progress?</h4>

<p>Has been so far.</p>

<p>Although caveats with regulation/taxation/x-risk</p>

<p>Having no growth kicks people back into zero-sum dynamics</p>

<h3>Markets are (at least at the Moment) Mostly Aligned</h3>

<p>Alignment of markets is &gt;90%.</p>

<h2>Different Aspects of Libertarianism</h2>

<h3>Amount of Regulation</h3>

<h3>Amount of Taxation</h3>

<h3>Amount of Redistribution</h3>

<h3>Amount of Inequality</h3>

<h2>Two (Maybe Three or Four) Problems With Pure Libertarianism</h2>

<h3>Externalities</h3>

<h3>Funding Public Goods</h3>

<h4>How Much Are Public Goods?</h4>

<p>E.g. is animal suffering in factory farming a public good?</p>

<h4>Different People Consider Different Things Public Goods</h4>

<p>Aggregate their preference vectors linearly.</p>

<h3>Human Manipulation and Addiction</h3>

<h3>Increasing Marginal Returns</h3>

<p>Many economists believe diminishing marginal returns, what reasons do
they have?</p>

<h2>Two Taxes I Like, One I Dislike, And One I'm Unsure About</h2>

<h3>Taxes I Like</h3>

<h4>Harberger Taxes</h4>

<h4>Pigou Taxes</h4>

<p>Problem: Hard to compute.</p>

<h3>Taxes I Dislike</h3>

<h4>Exchange Taxes</h4>

<p>Stifling pareto improvements.</p>

<h3>Unsure</h3>

<h4>Land-Value Taxes</h4>

<h2>The Problems With Regulation</h2>

<h3>Regulations Are Usually Not Tested</h3>

<h3>Regulations Are Usually Very Inflexible</h3>

<h3>Regulations Are Usually Not Retracted</h3>

<h2>How Much To Redistribute is an Empirical Question</h2>

<p>Heuristic against: Disincentivizes production, since more redistribution
makes production more like a public good, and public goods are hard
to fund.</p>

<p>Heuristic against: People <em>do</em> seem motivated by large amounts of money.</p>

<p>Heuristic in favour: There are strong social incentives for people to
want to work.</p>

<p>Heuristic in favour: Shlegeris says so.</p>

<h2>Some Low-key Utopias</h2>

<h3>A-Btopia</h3>

<p>Test your damn laws.</p>

<h3>Decaytopia</h3>

<p>At least it's not forever.</p>

<h3>Futarchy</h3>

<p>Spectrum from "Politicians sometimes look at prediction markets" to
"“What do you mean by politicians? We quadratically vote our values,
then the markets optimize for us.”"/Raikoth</p>

<h4>Problems With Futarchy</h4>

<h5>Correlation of Payout-Currency and Policies</h5>

<p>Possible solution: create a stable independent currency (maybe with
crypto, isn't there a Wei currency that tries to achieve this?)</p>

<h5>Goodhardts Law</h5>

<p>Mild optimization by reducing size/funding for prediction markets.</p>

<p>Resulting problem: this makes manipulation easier.</p>

<h5>Reward Hacking</h5>

<p>Don't know how to approach this one, maybe secret cabal of data
collectors? Data collectors are not allowed to trade?</p>

<h2>Miscellania</h2>

<h3>Democracy</h3>

<h4>Democracy Is Good For One Thing We Don't Really Use It For</h4>

<p>Discovering values, not policies.</p>

<h4>Modern Democracies Are Highly Indirect For A Reason</h4>

<h4>Voting Is Participating In A Public Good</h4>

<h3>Inequality</h3>

<h4>Inequality Might be About Grabbing</h4>

<h4>Why So Specific Inequality?</h4>

<h3>Most Complaints About Capitalism are Complaints About Other People Not Caring</h3>

<h3>Unions Seem Good, Let's Regulate Them Like Companies!</h3>

<p>Use the same cartel laws for unions as for companies.</p>

<h3>Regulate/Tax Companies Proportional to Size</h3>

<h3>Nate Soares Should Release His Notes on this Topic</h3>

<h3>Some Infuriating Arguments Related to Economics</h3>

<h4>“If We Fix Climate-Change and it Wasn't A Concern, We Will Have Lost Nothing”</h4>

<p>Opportunity cost, huge: around $100b per year.</p>

<p>This is not to say that I believe climate change to be harmless,
I don't, and currently believe the recommendations in <a href="https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-1-review-of-basics/">Marblestone
2019a</a>,
<a href="https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-2-co2-removal/">Marblestone
2019b</a>
and <a href="https://longitudinal.blog/co2-series-part-3-other-interventions/">Marblestone
2019c</a>
to be reasonable (although geoengineering seems quite dangerous, and
should probably only be used as a last measure, if at all).</p>

<h4>“We Should Regulate Companies Rather Than Encouraging Individual Actions”</h4>

<p>Regulating companies propagates down higher prices to customers, since
what you want to regulate is more ineffective than current practices
(i.e. costs more).</p>

<p>There are other reasons why regulating companies might be better (more
concentrated leverage points, more fine-grained control).</p>

<p>But there's no free lunch here, people will probably suffer because
of this.</p>
