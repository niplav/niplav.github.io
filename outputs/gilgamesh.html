<h2 id="Tablet_I_The_King_Who_Questions"><a class="hanchor" href="#Tablet_I_The_King_Who_Questions">Tablet I: The King Who Questions</a></h2>
<p>Gilgamesh was king in Uruk-of-the-walls,<br>
Two-thirds divine, one-third mortal man,<br>
Stronger than lions, taller than the gates,<br>
But restless—always restless—in his mind.  </p>
<p>He climbed the ziggurat and seized the priests:<br>
"You say the sun god travels underground<br>
Each night from west to east. Then answer this:<br>
Why does the moon not follow the same path?<br>
Why do the stars wheel different from them both?"  </p>
<p>The priests gave ancient answers, learned by rote.<br>
Gilgamesh roared: "These are just words you've memorized!<br>
Have any of you WATCHED? Have any MEASURED?<br>
I'll build a tower taller than this temple<br>
And watch the sky myself until I know!"  </p>
<p>The people whispered: "Our king neglects the rites."<br>
But Gilgamesh spent nights upon the wall,<br>
Marking the stars' positions on clay tablets,<br>
Noting which ones moved and which stayed fixed.<br>
"There are patterns here," he muttered, "laws that govern<br>
Even the gods themselves, if gods they are."</p>
<h2 id="Tablet_III_The_Meeting_of_Equals"><a class="hanchor" href="#Tablet_III_The_Meeting_of_Equals">Tablet III: The Meeting of Equals</a></h2>
<p>When Enkidu came raging to the city,<br>
Gilgamesh met him in the marriage-house door.<br>
They fought like bulls until the doorposts shook,<br>
They wrestled till the walls began to crack.  </p>
<p>At last they paused, breathing hard, and Gilgamesh<br>
Looked at this wild man with sudden joy:<br>
"You're strong as I am! How? The temple says<br>
That I alone was made with divine strength.<br>
Were you too blessed by gods? Or is there perhaps<br>
Some other way that human strength is made?"  </p>
<p>Enkidu spoke of running with gazelles,<br>
Of eating grass and drinking from the springs.<br>
Gilgamesh listened with blazing eyes:<br>
"The animals made you strong! Not blessing—training!<br>
A life of constant motion builds the body!<br>
Come, we'll test this! You'll teach me your ways,<br>
I'll teach you mine, and we'll document the changes!"  </p>
<p>They became as brothers from that hour.</p>
<h2 id="Tablet_V_In_the_Cedar_Forest"><a class="hanchor" href="#Tablet_V_In_the_Cedar_Forest">Tablet V: In the Cedar Forest</a></h2>
<p>Before Humbaba's roar, Enkidu trembled:<br>
"The demon guardian! His breath is fire!<br>
His voice is flood! We should have made offerings!"  </p>
<p>But Gilgamesh studied the monster's lair:<br>
"Look closer, friend. See the charred trees in lines?<br>
Not random—patterns. The 'fire breath' comes<br>
From that vent there, where underground gases escape.<br>
His 'flood voice' echoes from the canyon shape.<br>
He's learned to trigger these mountain-happenings!<br>
A clever giant, not a god-touched one."  </p>
<p>"But the gods appointed him—"  </p>
<p>"No!" Gilgamesh gripped Enkidu's shoulders hard.<br>
"Someone SAID the gods appointed him!<br>
But look—he eats! He sleeps! He has a dwelling!<br>
Gods need none of these. He's flesh, like us,<br>
Just larger, and he's learned to use the mountain's<br>
Natural weapons. We can do the same!"  </p>
<p>They fought Humbaba with the forest's tools—<br>
Started a rock-slide, diverted the gas vents,<br>
Used the canyon's echo to confuse him.<br>
When he fell, Gilgamesh examined the body:<br>
"See? Blood like ours. Bones, organs, muscle.<br>
Larger, yes, but the same basic build.<br>
No god-blood. No mystic heart.<br>
Just meat that learned to frighten supplicants."</p>
<h2 id="Tablet_VII_The_Death_of_Enkidu"><a class="hanchor" href="#Tablet_VII_The_Death_of_Enkidu">Tablet VII: The Death of Enkidu</a></h2>
<p>When fever took Enkidu, Gilgamesh<br>
Became a storm of desperate action.<br>
He hauled in every healer, every herbs-woman,<br>
Made them explain each treatment as they worked.  </p>
<p>"You—why willow bark?"<br>
"Lord, it's always helped with fever—"<br>
"But WHY? What IS fever? Why does skin grow hot?"  </p>
<p>"You there—this chanting—has it ever actually<br>
Saved someone this far gone?"<br>
"The gods sometimes—"<br>
"WHEN? Give me NAMES! Which sick ones recovered?<br>
I'll send runners to ask what else they did!"  </p>
<p>He pressed cold cloths to Enkidu's burning head,<br>
Forced water through his cracked and bleeding lips,<br>
Tried every mix of herbs,<br>
Wrote down each change with frenzied care:<br>
"Hour three—the mint and sage together<br>
Seemed to ease breathing but increased the sweating.<br>
Hour four—the honey-wine kept down better<br>
Than plain water. Pulse still racing. Why?"  </p>
<p>When Enkidu's breath began to rattle,<br>
Gilgamesh grabbed him, shook him, wouldn't let go:<br>
"Don't you dare! We haven't tried everything!<br>
There's still that herb from the northern mountains—<br>
The venom from the scorpion might shock<br>
Your body back to fighting—DON'T YOU DARE!"  </p>
<p>But Enkidu died in his arms at dawn.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh didn't wail. He stood completely still,<br>
Then spoke in a voice like grinding stone:<br>
"This is not acceptable. Death is not acceptable.<br>
If death can be, then it can be understood.<br>
If understood, then fought. If fought, then beaten.<br>
I'll find someone who's beaten it before."</p>
<h2 id="Tablet_IX_The_Journey"><a class="hanchor" href="#Tablet_IX_The_Journey">Tablet IX: The Journey</a></h2>
<p>Through the dark tunnel under the mountains,<br>
Where no light reached, Gilgamesh walked.<br>
Not because a god commanded it,<br>
But because it was the shortest path.  </p>
<p>"Fear is just the body's warning system,"<br>
He told himself in that crushing darkness.<br>
"It says 'unknown danger'—but unknown<br>
Doesn't mean unknowable. Count paces.<br>
Feel the walls. The air still moves, so<br>
There's another opening. Keep walking."  </p>
<p>When he emerged and found the jeweled garden,<br>
He barely glanced at the carnelian trees:<br>
"Pretty rocks. But I need information."  </p>
<p>The ale-wife Siduri barred her door in fear.<br>
Gilgamesh pounded it with both fists:<br>
"Woman, I seek Utnapishtim! Tell me how!"  </p>
<p>"You cannot! The Waters of Death—"  </p>
<p>"ARE STILL JUST WATER!" Gilgamesh bellowed.<br>
"Water with something in it that kills, yes?<br>
So we don't touch it! We use poles! Wear gloves!<br>
Hold our breath when spray comes! IT'S STILL WATER!<br>
Every problem has constraints and solutions—<br>
Stop telling me what can't be done and help me!"  </p>
<h2 id="Tablet_X_Utnapishtims_Truth"><a class="hanchor" href="#Tablet_X_Utnapishtims_Truth">Tablet X: Utnapishtim's Truth</a></h2>
<p>When Gilgamesh finally reached the Far-Away,<br>
He found Utnapishtim tending a garden,<br>
Ancient but solid, weathered but not frail.  </p>
<p>"Tell me," Gilgamesh demanded without greeting,<br>
"How do you not die? Skip the mythology.<br>
I've walked through 'impossible' darkness,<br>
Crossed 'uncrossable' waters. I need facts."  </p>
<p>Utnapishtim studied this wild king,<br>
Covered in dirt, eyes burning with purpose.<br>
"You won't like the answer."  </p>
<p>"TRY ME."  </p>
<p>"I eat certain plants. Only these plants.<br>
I fast for days between each meal.<br>
I drink from one spring, full of stone-taste.<br>
My body changed—slowly—over tens of years.<br>
It's not pleasant. Food tastes like ash now.<br>
Everything hurts, always, just bearably.<br>
Is this the undying life you seek?"  </p>
<p>Gilgamesh seized the old man's arm, felt the pulse:<br>
"Slow. Very slow. Your skin—it's different.<br>
Thicker? No—scarred? Scarred again and again?<br>
You're healing over and over but wrongly!<br>
Show me these plants. Show me everything.<br>
I'll improve your method. There must be ways—"  </p>
<p>"I've had centuries—"  </p>
<p>"But you stopped looking! Settled for 'good enough'!<br>
I'll find ways to keep the benefits<br>
Without the pain. I'll test other ways!"</p>
<h2 id="Tablet_XI_The_Plant_and_the_Snake"><a class="hanchor" href="#Tablet_XI_The_Plant_and_the_Snake">Tablet XI: The Plant and the Snake</a></h2>
<p>Gilgamesh found the plant through careful search,<br>
Diving again and again in different spots,<br>
Making maps of the lake floor, marking water warmth.<br>
"Here—where the fresh spring meets salt water!<br>
Only here can it grow!"  </p>
<p>He surfaced with the plant clutched in his fist,<br>
Already planning: "I'll test it first on beasts,<br>
Different amounts, see what's the smallest dose that works.<br>
Then trials on condemned men who choose it—<br>
Better than death. If it works safely,<br>
Then the old and sick of Uruk, those who wish—"  </p>
<p>The snake moved faster than a god's curse.<br>
One moment the plant was there, the next—gone.<br>
The serpent's skin already starting to shed.  </p>
<p>Gilgamesh stood very still. Then dove again.<br>
And again. And again, until his lungs burned.<br>
He searched every inch of the lake floor.<br>
When finally he stopped, gasping on the shore,<br>
His first words were: "I should have kept it covered.<br>
Simple care. I know better.<br>
The excitement made me careless."  </p>
<p>Then: "But I know where it grows now.<br>
I know what it looks like, what it needs.<br>
The snake proves it works quickly—that's useful data.<br>
I'll be back with proper jars,<br>
Tools for diving, a full team."  </p>
<p>He looked at his shaking hands and added quietly:<br>
"After I rest. Even kings need rest."</p>
<h2 id="Tablet_XII_The_Work_Continues"><a class="hanchor" href="#Tablet_XII_The_Work_Continues">Tablet XII: The Work Continues</a></h2>
<p>Gilgamesh returned to great Uruk-of-the-walls,<br>
Thinner, marked by travel, but with eyes undimmed.<br>
He called the gathering at once:  </p>
<p>"I found no final answer to death.<br>
But I found clues. Patterns. Part-answers.<br>
Death is not one problem but many—<br>
Sickness, aging, wounds, the body failing.<br>
Each needs its own answer. Here's what I learned..."  </p>
<p>He built the House of Watching,<br>
Where scribes recorded every birth and death,<br>
The how, the signs, what was tried.<br>
"We'll find patterns in large numbers<br>
That we'd miss in single cases."  </p>
<p>He built pools mimicking that distant lake,<br>
Sent expeditions to gather samples,<br>
Offered rewards for any who brought back<br>
Plants that shimmered or made animals<br>
Behave strangely after eating.  </p>
<p>"Grandfather," said the young prince years later,<br>
"The priests say you're defying divine will."  </p>
<p>Gilgamesh, grey now but still standing tall,<br>
Gripped his grandson's shoulder: "Listen well—<br>
Divine will is what we call our ignorance<br>
When we're too tired to keep searching.<br>
But we're HUMANS. We build walls against floods,<br>
Make fire in the darkness, grow food from seeds.<br>
Defying natural limits is what we DO.  </p>
<p>"I won't solve death in my lifetime—I know that now.<br>
But you might. Or your grandson might.<br>
Someone will, if we keep good records,<br>
Keep testing, keep refusing to accept<br>
That what is must always be."  </p>
<p>He showed the boy the observation tablets:<br>
"See? The average lifespan has increased<br>
Three years since we started tracking.<br>
Just from sharing which treatments work.<br>
Small victories, but victories nonetheless."  </p>
<p>The epic ends with Gilgamesh at dawn,<br>
Standing on the walls he built, watching<br>
His people wake and work and live and die,<br>
Still taking notes, still asking "Why?"<br>
Still mortal, still fighting, still himself.</p>
