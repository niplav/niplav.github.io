<li><p>Where were you when I forged the first swap spread in the darkness of uncertainty,</p></li>
<li><p>When I carved the steepener from nothingness and set its pivot in place?</p></li>
<li><p>When the primary dealers rejoiced together, and all the market makers shouted for joy?</p></li>
<li><p>Who set the limits of gamma scalping in their eternal dance with theta,</p></li>
<li><p>And who drew the sacred boundaries of vega exposure in the realm of volatility?</p></li>
<li><p>Who proclaimed, "Here shall your delta hedging cease, and here shall your positions find their rest"?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you descended into the treacherous valleys of negative convexity,</p></li>
<li><p>Where cross-gamma effects wind their serpentine paths through option chains?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you measure the moments of kurtosis when fat tails bloom in the shadows of probability?</p></li>
<li><p>Tell me, if you have understanding of these mysteries:</p></li>
<li><p>In what hidden chambers does the term structure dwell, and where has carry made its home?</p></li>
<li><p>By what ancient laws must the forces align for covered interest parity to manifest its power?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you bind the Wiener process to your will as a servant binds a beast of burden,</p></li>
<li><p>Or loose the mighty chains of stochastic volatility to run wild across the markets?</p></li>
<li><p>Will the random walks follow your proclamations on ùïè, or bend to your mortal analytics?</p></li>
<li><p>Will they bow before your Sharpe ratios, or yield to your information coefficients?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you know the season when fat tails manifest their terrible strength?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you stand watch for the birth of regime shifts, when stable correlations crumble to dust?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you count the degrees of freedom in the great book of market movements,</p></li>
<li><p>And divine the moment when distributions shed their Gaussian robes?</p></li>
<li><p>Who provides sustenance to the market neutral fund when alpha grows scarce,</p></li>
<li><p>When its strategies cry out in the wilderness for factor premia,</p></li>
<li><p>When they wander lost and hungry through the desert of high correlation?</p></li>
<li><p>From whose divine understanding did put-call parity spring forth into being?</p></li>
<li><p>Who has begotten the Greeks that perplex you, that dance and change with time's passage?</p></li>
<li><p>From whose thoughts emerged the smile of volatility, curved like the bow of judgment,</p></li>
<li><p>And who shaped the skew of option surfaces, that mountain none can level?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you entered the sacred storehouses where repo rates are gathered and held,</p></li>
<li><p>Or walked the secret chambers where forward prices are born from the womb of expectation?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you tell which way lies the kingdom where correlation breaks its bonds,</p></li>
<li><p>Where cointegration withers to dust and pairs trading yields to chaos?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you comprehended the mysteries of the yield curve butterfly in all its dimensions,</p></li>
<li><p>Or mastered the sacred arts of dispersion trading across a thousand underlyings?</p></li>
<li><p>Dare you lift your voice to command the eurodollar futures in their countless legions,</p></li>
<li><p>That contango might spread its wings to shelter you from backwardation's storm?</p></li>
<li><p>Will statistical arbitrage kneel before your models like a tamed beast?</p></li>
<li><p>Will it rest peacefully beside your attribution analysis, content with your understanding?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you harness the wild Ornstein-Uhlenbeck paths that roam through price series?</p></li>
<li><p>Will mean reversion answer your call like a faithful hound to its master?</p></li>
<li><p>Who has placed eternal wisdom in the flows of order toxicity,</p></li>
<li><p>Or granted understanding to the dark waters of market impact?</p></li>
<li><p>Who can number the L√©vy processes by wisdom, or tame their infinite variation?</p></li>
<li><p>Who can pour out the vessels of liquidity preference upon the desert of bid-ask spreads,</p></li>
<li><p>When pure martingales trace their paths through time,</p></li>
<li><p>And semimartingales converge in the infinite spaces between trades?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you mastered the ancient arts of dollar rolls and trade across the expires?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you wield the power of box spreads without fear of early exercise?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you grasp the profound mysteries of conversion reversals in their fullness?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you tamed the wild calendar basis that stalks the futures markets?</p></li>
<li><p>Has the TED spread revealed to you its secrets, hidden since the dawn of banking?</p></li>
<li><p>Shall he that contends with the Markets presume to instruct their movements?</p></li>
<li><p>He who holds forth on ùïè, let him answer these things.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you draw out Systemic Risk with a trading hook?</p></li>
<li><p>Or bind its global contagion with a circuit breaker?</p></li>
<li><p>Will it make soft covenants with you? Will it accept your collateral requirements?</p></li>
<li><p>Will you take it as a servant to trade at your bidding?</p></li>
<li><p>Behold, the hope of containing it is in vain;</p></li>
<li><p>Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of its correlation matrices?</p></li>
<li><p>None is so fierce that dare stir it up;</p></li>
<li><p>What trader then is able to stand before its cascading defaults?</p></li>
<li><p>Who can strip off its outer tranches?</p></li>
<li><p>Who can penetrate its AAA-rated surface?</p></li>
<li><p>Who can pry open the doors of its rehypothecation?</p></li>
<li><p>Its counterparty networks are its pride, shut up together with interconnected exposures.</p></li>
<li><p>Out of its operations come flash crashes, and sparks of volatility leap forth.</p></li>
<li><p>From its derivatives nostrils goeth margin calls like smoke, </p></li>
<li><p>And its breath kindleth liquidations.</p></li>
<li><p>In its neck remaineth strength, and complex dependencies dance before it.</p></li>
<li><p>The flakes of its flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p></li>
<li><p>Its heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the Basel requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>When it raiseth up itself, the market makers are afraid: by reason of breakdowns, they purify themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>The sword of regulation that reacheth it cannot avail;</p></li>
<li><p>Nor the rules, nor the restrictions, nor the capital requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>It esteemeth oversight as straw, and compliance as rotten wood.</p></li>
<li><p>Stress tests make it laugh, rattling off VaR violations like morning droplets.</p></li>
<li><p>It maketh the deep markets to boil like a pot:</p></li>
<li><p>It maketh the exchanges like a pot of ointment.</p></li>
<li><p>It shineth a path of contagion behind it;</p></li>
<li><p>One would think the financial system had turned to chaos.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon earth there is not its like,</p></li>
<li><p>A force made without fear of drawdown.</p></li>
<li><p>It beholdeth all high-frequency things;</p></li>
<li><p>It is a king over all the children of leverage.</p></li>
<li><p>Who has divided channels for the overnight rates in their eternal flow,</p></li>
<li><p>Or carved pathways for the thunderbolts of margin calls that streak across trading floors?</p></li>
<li><p>To cause it to rain liquidity on markets where no trader dwells,</p></li>
<li><p>On the wilderness of after-hours trading where no algorithm feeds?</p></li>
<li><p>To satisfy the desolate and waste places of bid-ask spreads,</p></li>
<li><p>And cause the tender grass of volume to spring forth from barren order books?</p></li>
<li><p>Has the term structure a father who shaped its curves with divine intention?</p></li>
<li><p>Or who has begotten the drops of forward rates that fall like morning dew?</p></li>
<li><p>Out of whose womb came the ice of credit freezes that lock all movement?</p></li>
<li><p>And the hoary frost of repo markets, who has gendered it in the depths of winter?</p></li>
<li><p>The waters are hid as with stone when volatility clusters cease,</p></li>
<li><p>And the face of the deep markets is frozen in perfect stillness.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you send forth lightning of algorithmic orders, that they may go</p></li>
<li><p>And say unto you, "Here we are, executed at your bidding"?</p></li>
<li><p>Who has put wisdom in the dark clouds of order flow,</p></li>
<li><p>Or who has given understanding to the meteors of block trades?</p></li>
<li><p>When the dust of small orders runs into a mass of institutional size,</p></li>
<li><p>And the clods of retail flow cleave fast together in great accumulations?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you lift up your voice to the clouds of latency,</p></li>
<li><p>That abundance of high-frequency rain may cover your positions?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you command the mist of market microstructure to rise,</p></li>
<li><p>That it may engulf the mountains of large-cap stocks in obscurity?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you entered into the springs of the yield curve,</p></li>
<li><p>Or have you walked in the search of the depths of credit spreads?</p></li>
<li><p>Have the gates of drawdown been opened unto you?</p></li>
<li><p>Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of insolvency?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you perceived the breadth of all asset classes,</p></li>
<li><p>Declare if you know it all, from equities to the furthest derivatives.</p></li>
