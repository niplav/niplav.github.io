</head><body><p>The iron lung stands still<br>
On Smithsonian's hill<br>
No more children gasping air<br>
No more summers filled with fear<br>
When pools and parks lay dead<br>
We still face other viral foes, but not this ancient dread  </p>
<p>Raise your droplets high<br>
Two drops that testify<br>
To Sabin, Salk who led the way<br>
And millions vaccinated, they<br>
Built immunity round<br>
If nothing else was ever fixed, they drove this terror down  </p>
<p>Yet headlines seldom show<br>
How close we are to go<br>
They speak of variants unknown<br>
Of vaccine trust overthrown<br>
And myths that carry on<br>
New fears may rise to take its place, but this one's nearly gone  </p>
<p>Some still resist the shot<br>
Though history forgot<br>
When parents lived in summer's fear<br>
Of paralysis drawn near<br>
To steal their children's breath<br>
But nation after nation chose to spare them from this death  </p>
<p>The iron lung stands still<br>
On Smithsonian's hill<br>
No more children gasping air<br>
No more summers filled with fear<br>
When pools and parks lay dead<br>
We still face other viral foes, but not this ancient dread<br>
Oh no!<br>
We still face other viral foes, but not this ancient dread!  </p>
