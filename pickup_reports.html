<h2>Approaches</h2>

<h3>2022-03-12</h3>

<h4>Schizo Woman</h4>

<p>I approached her during a Saturday daygame session with a wing. Probably
in her late twenties, dressed kind of weirdly (dark grayish green coat
and pants). When I started talking to her, I started stacking about her
outfit, and suggested that she was probably off to mountaineering.</p>

<p>She took the hooks perfectly, and I was already internally fist-pumping,
but then she started talking non-stop about her hiking trip to a holy
mountain in Tibet, and how 10 people had died there when ascending the
mountain against the better advice of the locals. I've never had any
experience like this in set: she went on rambling for probably 3 minutes
(those of you who have done daygame approaches know that this is super
uncommon, and only happens if either the women is super into you or
crazy ‚Äî possibly both).</p>

<p>When I got talking again, she compulsively opened and closed her jacket
probably five times, bending her body weirdly to do so (I am pretty sure
it was not intended to be sexy).</p>

<p>I got her number, and went back to my wing to pour my heart out about how
confusing the experience had been (it is hard for me to convey how high
her schizo-energy had been over text, but believe me: it was frightening).</p>

<p>I messaged her a day or two later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: ‚ÄúHi [‚Ä¶], it was cool meeting you yesterday. Are you always this friendly to strangers üòâ?‚Äù <br />
Her: ‚ÄúHey‚Äù <br />
‚ÄúI am‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excellent texting from her side.</p>

<p>I left it at that, both considering that she didn't seem like she could
consent to anything, and also fearing for the health of my reproductive
organs in the event that we would meet up.</p>

<h4>French First Love</h4>

<p>I approached her in the same session as the <a href="./pickup_reports.html#Schizo-Woman">schizo
woman</a>, a bit later. She was a
student on an exchange program, and only in the city for a short while.
Quite giggly, and just blazing with feminine energy and playfulness ‚Äî
one of those women who are maybe a high seven looks wise (not dressed very
stylishly, but she was quite pretty), but who boost their attractiveness
with their personality. She is the only "nine" I have approached
so far (out of ~350 approaches). Most of that attractiveness comes from
her behavior, building on a solid foundation of physical cuteness.</p>

<p>Just‚Ä¶wow. Amazing.</p>

<p>Pseudo-psychoanalyzing myself a bit, I think I was attracted to her so
much because she looked &amp; behaved a bit like the first and only girl
I fell in Love with (as in capital L, the stuff that is comparable to
psychoactive substances in intensity).</p>

<p>I was probably too nerdy in the approach, talking about the French
existentialists, and guessing she studied philosophy. I also exited the
approach too quickly, and asked "Why?" when she said she didn't want
to give me her contact details, but in a non-playful way (something like
"I bet you've never had a [country] [‚Ä¶] lover before!" would have
been much better). I was smitten after the approach.</p>

<p>She was on. She was enjoying the approach, or perhaps just the attention.
But she was on.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://daysofgame.com">Nash</a> always says: </p>

<p>Viva Daygame.</p>

It worked pretty well, 22 approaches (twice optimal normal rate), AA

<h3>Super Honest Non-SDL</h3>

<p>She was the last stop on a 4-hour 13-approach spree (still a big number
for me, working my vibe towards higher numbers of approaches). She was
wearing all black, so I opened her by comparing her to a large black
candle. She stood very close to me, and my vibe was upbeat (if a bit
tired). I quickly found out that she was a tourist, and it was the last
day of her visit, so I would have to try to make it an SDL (which, with
only one lay under my belt, seemed like a titanic endeavour). She seemed
very keen, inviting me to join her at the museum, which I rejected at
first, instead taking her instagram and talking about meeting her later
that day.</p>

<p>Joining up with my wing, and telling him about the set, he strongly
encouraged me to shoot for an SDL, so I messaged her that I'd join her
at the museum (I know that it was needy, but she seemed very on, and I'd
told her I would meet a friend later, and in fact I had a date lined up
later that day with a Mexican girl). I messaged my date and asked her
if she could meet up a bit earlier (a good flake check), sort of hoping
she would flake on me, while I walked toward the museum. Once there,
I tried to find Miss Candle, but she was already inside the museum. I
contemplated buying a ticket, but decided that it would be too needy,
and instead decided to check out the logistics around the area.</p>

<p>Searching for good bars, I received a flake text from the Mexican girl,
causing me to feel an emotion that I had never felt before ‚Äî an odd
sense between an inner sigh and an inner fist-pump. Bingo. The SDL-attempt
was on. I did two more approaches, found a bar, ordered a beer, and told
Miss Candle where I was.</p>

<p>She joined me half an hour later, asking me where my friend was;
my response being something along the lines of "he's probably
with a girl somewhere". Started off with random chit-chat about
exercise, travel, interest etc. while I amped up the kino. At
some point she looked at me and told me that she was only seeing
me as a friend, to which I replied with the old Ross Jeffries line
"I don't like putting relationships between people into boxes like
that, but I promise that if anything ever happens between us, it
will be comfortable, and we will be willing and ready" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game:_Penetrating_the_Secret_Society_of_Pickup_Artists" title="The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists">Strauss 2005 p.
52</a>
(praise the lineage of players before me handing down their wisdom). She
laughed and we carried on with the conversation.</p>

<p>After a while I bounced her to another bar, where we continued
the conversation and I amped up the kino, laying my arm around her.
I tried to kiss her (thrice), each time she rejected it with a laugh,
and I told her each time I would try again, to which she just giggled
and continued with the conversation. She knew about the questions game,
so we played it, her being doubting my answer of having had 4 girlfriends
and 8 sexual partners in total, believing I was understating the number
(the real number being 2 girlfriends and 1 sexual partner).</p>

<p>I was really enjoying being honest with her about my intentions in a way
I had never been before with a woman ‚Äî she knew exactly where we stood,
I had exactly communicated to her what I wanted, and that we were engaged
in the playful dance of seduction and resistance. Glorious.</p>

<p>Around 22:00 she wanted to meet up with a friend of hers at a club, and
I was enjoying her company so much that I walked to the club with her,
talking about bisexuality, the beauty of middle-Eastern women, how she
saw sex as something to do for fun, similar to exercise (major green
flag!) and me possibly visiting her in Barcelona. Once at the club, I
decided it was not going to lead anywhere, and when her friend arrived,
I told him I'd been unsuccessful at seducing her, and hopped on public
transport back home.</p>

<p>This encounter held major lessons for me: Escalating is much easier
after a successful session of daygame, and alcohol makes escalating
much easier; being honest about what you want and expressing those
desires is awesome and can earn you major respect (making you seem
much more like a player); and I got a good feel for what verbal
escalation feels like. It felt like I finally got the ticket to the
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/antechamber">antechamber</a>
of the secret society.</p>

<p>I do not plan on visiting her in Barcelona (she responded positively to a
ping the next day), because I don't like traveling, but even without any
further interaction, this is my current favourite encounter from daygame.</p>
