<h1>Pickup Reports</h1>

<h2>Approaches</h2>

<h3>2022-03-12</h3>

<h4>Schizo Woman</h4>

<p>I approached her during a Saturday daygame session with a wing. Probably
in her late twenties, dressed kind of weirdly (dark grayish green coat
and pants). When I started talking to her, I started stacking about her
outfit, and suggested that she was probably off to mountaineering.</p>

<p>She took the hooks perfectly, and I was already internally fist-pumping,
but then she started talking non-stop about her hiking trip to a holy
mountain in Tibet, and how 10 people had died there when ascending the
mountain against the better advice of the locals. I've never had any
experience like this in set: she went on rambling for probably 3 minutes
(those of you who have done daygame approaches know that this is super
uncommon, and only happens if either the women is super into you or
crazy ‚Äî possibly both).</p>

<p>When I got talking again, she compulsively opened and closed her jacket
probably five times, bending her body weirdly to do so (I am pretty sure
it was not intended to be sexy).</p>

<p>I got her number, and went back to my wing to pour my heart out about how
confusing the experience had been (it is hard for me to convey how high
her schizo-energy had been over text, but believe me: it was frightening).</p>

<p>I messaged her a day or two later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: ‚ÄúHi [‚Ä¶], it was cool meeting you yesterday. Are you always this friendly to strangers üòâ?‚Äù <br />
Her: ‚ÄúHey‚Äù <br />
‚ÄúI am‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excellent texting from her side.</p>

<p>I left it at that, both considering that she didn't seem like she could
consent to anything, and also fearing for the health of my reproductive
organs in the event that we would meet up.</p>

<h4>French First Love</h4>

<p>I approached her in the same session as Schizo Woman, a bit later. She was
a student on an exchange program, and only in the city for a short while.
Quite giggly, and just blazing with feminine energy and playfulness ‚Äî
one of those women who are maybe a high seven looks wise (not dressed very
stylishly, but she was quite pretty), but who boost their attractiveness
with their personality. She is the only ‚Äúnine‚Äù I have approached
so far (out of ~350 approaches). Most of that attractiveness comes from
her behavior, building on a solid foundation of physical cuteness.</p>

<p>Just‚Ä¶wow. Amazing.</p>

<p>Pseudo-psychoanalyzing myself a bit, I think I was attracted to her so
much because she looked &amp; behaved a bit like the first and only girl
I fell in Love with (as in capital L, the stuff that is comparable to
psychoactive substances in intensity).</p>

<p>I was probably too nerdy in the approach, talking about the French
existentialists, and guessing she studied philosophy. I also exited the
approach too quickly, and asked ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù when she said she didn't want
to give me her contact details, but in a non-playful way (something like
‚ÄúI bet you've never had a [country] [‚Ä¶] lover before!‚Äù would have
been much better). I was smitten after the approach.</p>

<p>She was on. She was enjoying herself, or maybe just the attention.
But she was on.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://daysofgame.com">Nash</a> always says: </p>

<p>Viva Daygame.</p>
