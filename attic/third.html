<p><strong><em>IC* Algorithm</em></strong> (<strong>Inductive Causation with Latent Variables</strong>)<br/>
<strong>Input:</strong> <code>$\hat{P}$</code>, a stable distribution (with respect to some latent structure).<br/>
<strong>Output</strong>: core (<code>$\hat{P}$</code>), a marked pattern.<br/>
1. For each pair of variables <code>$a$</code> and <code>$b$</code>, search for a set <code>$S_{ab}$</code> such that <code>$a$</code> and <code>$b$</code> are independent in <code>$\hat{P}$</code>, conditioned on <code>$S_{ab}$</code>. If there is no such <code>$S_{ab}$</code>, place an undirected link between the two variables, <code>$a—b$</code>.<br/>
2. For each pair of nonadjacent variables <code>$a$</code> and <code>$b$</code> with a common neighbor <code>$c$</code>, check if <code>$c \in S_{ab}$</code>.<br/>
        If it is, then continue.<br/>
        If it is not, then add arrowheads pointing at <code>$c$</code> (i.e., <code>$a \rightarrow c \leftarrow b$</code>).<br/>
3. In the partially directed graph that results, add (recursively) as many arrowheads as possible, and mark as many edges as possible, according to the following two rules:<br/>
        R₁: For each pair of nonadjacent nodes <code>$a$</code> and <code>$b$</code> with a common neighbor <code>$c$</code>, if the link between <code>$a$</code> and <code>$c$</code> has an arrowhead into <code>$c$</code> and if the link between <code>$c$</code> and <code>$b$</code> has no arrowhead into <code>$c$</code>, then the arrowhead on the link between <code>$c$</code> and <code>$b$</code> and the mark that link to obtain <code>$c \overset{*}{\rightarrow} b$</code>.<br/>
        R₂: If <code>$a$</code> and <code>$b$</code> are adjacent and there is a directed path (composed strictly of marked links) from <code>$a$</code> to <code>$b$</code> […], then add an arrowhead pointing toward <code>$b$</code> on the link between <code>$a$</code> and <code>$b$</code>.</p>

<p>So apparently the boyfriend of a woman I have been sleeping with has
commited suicide.</p>
<p>She had been the sixth of eight women I had talked to on a February
evening, there had been a tease of rain the whole day (but no actual
rain, not even a drizzle). I don't even remember what opener I'd used,
I had hit that mental state where it feels like your eyes have turned
so that they only show white, and you bang out one approach after another.</p>
<p>She neither gave me a Russian Minute nor giggled weirdly, but kept a
close coolness that I appreciated, since it wound me down a bit after two
blowouts and four awkward sets. Of course she mentioned her boyfriend,
and of course I neglected to react to it—standard human mating tactics,
as far as I was concerned. I didn't think she would give me her number,
but her end-twenties eyes showed no hesitation as I awkwardly pulled
out my phone and handed it to her.</p>
