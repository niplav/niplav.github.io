<h3 id="Baryons_Are_Scattered"><a class="hanchor" href="#Baryons_Are_Scattered">Baryons Are Scattered</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon">Baryons</a> make up only 4.5% of
the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-energy">massenergy</a>
of the universe. &gt;80% of that baryonic massenergy is intergalactic
dust or plasma—mostly hydrogen and helium with temperatures from
<code>$10^5$</code> to <code>$10^7 K$</code>, and if compressed to water density would
have temperatures from <code>$10^{31}$</code> to <code>$10^{34}K$</code> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42275384-grand-futures">Sandberg
2023</a>,
p. 746).</p>
<p>We or our descendants might care a lot about this massenergy, since if
we can't use dark matter or dark energy, it would represent most of the
resources available in the universe.</p>
<p>So it would be cool if we had a method of collecting this intergalacic
plasma &amp; dust, and ideally one that fulfills these properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cools down the collected plasma and uses the heat for useful work.</li>
<li>Leaves it in a state that admits energy-generation via nuclear fusion.</li>
<li>Is fast enough that most of the useful energy is extracted before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_Decay">protons start decaying</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For <a href="./doc/big_picture/fermi/eternity_in_6_hours_sandberg_armstrong_2013.pdf">intergalactic
colonization</a>,
an advanced civilization would want to move through intergalactic space at
very high speed—the closer to <code>$c$</code>, the better. But at such velocities,
collisions with dust and small particles create explosions releasing as
much energy as a hand grenade.</p>
<h3 id="Synthesis"><a class="hanchor" href="#Synthesis">Synthesis</a></h3>
<p>For a <a href="https://harsimony.wordpress.com/2022/09/13/black-hole-civilizations/">black hole
civilization</a>,
one option to fulfill some of the criteria for collecting
the IGM and shielding a probe would be to create intergalactic
"ships" that are composed of a coordinating, baryonic center and a
"shell" of black holes orbiting that center, moving at high speed
through the intergalactic medium, in a setup similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_Swarm">Dyson
swarm</a>. Alternatively,
the setup could be two or more black holes orbiting each
other, with the baryonic center stationary at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaGrange_Point">Lagrange
point</a> where it is shielded
by one or more of the black holes in the direction of travel.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./img/mop/dyson_swarm.png"/></p>
<p><em>This, but with black holes instead of mirrors. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42275384-grand-futures">Sandberg
2023</a>, p. 460</em></p>
<p>The black holes would "mop up" the intergalactic medium as the
craft would move through it, increasing in mass<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The heat of the
intergalactic medium would be converted to the mass of the black hole,
as black holes don't have any temperature and are <a href="https://www.weidai.com/black-holes.txt">excellent heat
sinks</a>; instead they emit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_Radiation">Hawking radiation</a>
in the black body spectrum.</p>
<p>One option is to use such black hole
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mop">mops</a> in intergalactic colonization,
where the black holes act as shielding for the center from collisions
with intergalactic gas. I think this would slow this construction down,
but usually not change its structure, though I haven't thought about it
very much.</p>
<p>How does this fare on our list of criteria?</p>
<ol>
<li>The heat of the plasma &amp; dust is converted perfectly into mass, but not used for anything productive.</li>
<li>The plasma is unavailable for fusion, and the form in which it later is emitted again Hawking radiation is less useful, as it happens over extremely long timespans.</li>
<li>I haven't yet calculated how much of the reachable universe could be plausibly covered this way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Black hole mops would have some other disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>They require advanced control over black holes, setting them up in stable complicated orbit around a center.</li>
<li>They probably require large numbers of small black holes, which increase in mass during the journey.
    1. This is a downside because small black holes are likely much more valuable, since they only come about after long evaporations of large black holes, or have to be constructed synthetically through extremely precise focusing of light.
    2. Potentially one could create stable orbits of three or more large black holes "covering" the construction in the direction of travel, similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system#Multiple_star_systems">multiple star systems</a>.</li>
<li>The black holes can probably not cover the central craft completely at all times, so some intergalactic medium would get lost and/or damage the central craft.</li>
<li>If the black holes are <em>orbiting</em> the central craft, it must have a very high mass.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite having mostly listed downsides of black hole mops, I think
they're an attractive option to do further reseach on.</p>
<p>I don't know whether such constructions are possible or desirable,
but I would like to hear some feedback by someone more knowledgeable
about physics.</p>

<h2 id="Questions"><a class="hanchor" href="#Questions">Questions</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Does this prevent the probe from being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bussard_Ramjet">Bussard ramjet</a>?</li>
<li>What the smallest cross-section one can make the probe?</li>
<li>Would the black hole(s) evaporate through Hawking radiation on the longest journeys, or would it/they expand?</li>
<li>Do(es) the black hole(s) form accretion disks, if yes, do they matter?</li>
<li>How difficult is it to steal the black hole(s) in this scenario?</li>

<p>I don't know whether the intergalactic medium is charged, if so the black holes would also accumulate charge. I assume that on a medium scale the intergalactic medium is fairly evenly distributed, so I don't think they'd accumulate angular momentum. <a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
