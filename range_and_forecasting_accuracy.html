<blockquote>
  <p>Above all, don’t ask what to believe—ask what to anticipate. Every
  question of belief should flow from a question of anticipation, and that
  question of anticipation should be the center of the inquiry. Every guess
  of belief should begin by flowing to a specific guess of anticipation,
  and should continue to pay rent in future anticipations. If a belief
  turns deadbeat, evict it.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikiki_Probabilistic_forecasting">Probabilistic forecasting</a>
that aggregates both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting#Qualitative_vs._quantitative_methods">qualitative and quantitative
methods</a>
is a comparatively simple idea. Basically, one needs to have only very few tools at ones
disposal to being ready to start forecasting:</p>

<ul>
<li>View of belief as probabilistic (perhaps with some bayesian epistemology)</li>
<li>Track records (grading results of forecasts using for example brier scores or log scores)</li>
<li>Probability theory (a concept of probabilities, and maybe some simple probability distributions)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier score</a> was invented
in 1950, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">Bayes' theorem</a>
was first described in 1763, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory">probability
theory</a> was properly
invented at the beginning of the 18th century.</p>

<p>However, attempting to use forecasting to seriously determine the
probability of future events, training &amp; selecting people for their
forecasting ability and creating procedures that incorporate both
intuition-based and model-based predictions have only been around since
the mid 1980's<!--TODO: citation needed-->, mostly popularized by the
work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehpilp_E._Tetlock">Philip Tetlock</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, forecasting has slowly but surely matured from "X is going
to happen because my intuition/divine revelation told me so" to "my
probability distribution on the outcome of this random variable is an X
distribution with the following parameters", or alternatively "I assign
a probability of X% to this event".</p>

<p>However, since this kind of forecasting is relatively recent, information
about the accuracy of long-range forecasting is basically non-existent:</p>

<blockquote>

  <li>Long-range forecasts are often stated
  too imprecisely to be judged for accuracy.

<p><!--TODO: put in info where Metaculus and PredictionBook fit into this--></p>

<p>In this text, I will try to look at the accuracy of short-term and
mid-term forecasting, which may shine some light on the relation between
the range of forecasts and their accuracy in general. The range of a
forecast is defined as the length of the timespan between the forecast
and the resolution of the forecast. Keeping with
<a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/how-feasible-long-range-forecasting" title="How Feasible Is Long-range Forecasting?">Muehlhauser 2019</a>,
I will define short-term forecasts as forecasts with a range of less than
a year, mid-range forecasts as forecasts with a range between 1 and 10
years, and long-term forecasts as forecasts with a range of more than 10
years (this distinction is not central to the following analysis, though).</p>

<p>Fortunately, for short- and mid-range forecasts, two easily accessible
sources of forecasts and their resolutions are available online: The
two forecasting websites <a href="https://predictionbook.com">PredictionBook</a>
and <a href="https://www.metaculus.com">Metaculus</a>.</p>

<p>To find out about the range of forecasts, I download, parse &amp; analyse
forecasting data from these sites.</p>

<p><!--
Make a point here that making forecasts is one of the best existing

<h2>Metaculus and PredictionBook</h2>

<p><a href="https://predictionbook.com">PredictionBook</a> and
<a href="https://www.metaculus.com">Metaculus</a> are both forecasting focussed
sites, though both are not prediction markets, but rather function on
the base of merit and track records: although you don't win money by
being right, you can still boast about it (although it seems questionable
whether other people will be impressed). Besides that, these sites make
it easier to train ones calibration on real-world questions and become
less wrong in the process.</p>

<p>However, both sites differ in their approach to writing, judging and
scoring forecasts. PredictionBook is much older than Metaculus: the
former was first released in 2008, the latter started in 2015. It is
also much less formal than Metaculus: it doesn't require stringent
resolution criteria, making possible for everybody to judge a
question (unrelated to whether the person has even made a prediction
on the question themselves!), while Metaculus requires a short text
explaining the context and resolution criteria for a question, with
the questions being resolved by moderators or admins. This leads to
Metaculus having less questions than PredictionBook, each question
having more predictions on it. Of the two, Metaculus is much more
feature-rich: It supports not only binary questions, but also range
questions with probability distributions, comment threads, having
closed questions (questions that haven't yet been resolved, but that
can still be predicted on), three different kinds of scores (the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier score</a>,
and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Logarithmic_scoring_rule">logarithmic scoring
rule</a>
for discrete and continuous forecasts each), as well as the Metaculus
prediction, a weighted aggregation of the forecasts of the best
forecasters on the site.</p>

<p>Another significant difference between these two websites is the amount of
data they publish: PredictionBook shows every single forecast made, while
on Metaculus one can only see the community forecast (a the time-weighted
median of the forecasts made on the question). This is relevant for this
analysis: The two approaches must be analysed separately.</p>

<h2>Getting the Data</h2>

<p>First of all, the data for both platforms needs to be made available in
a reasonable format. This works nicer for Metaculus, and is a bit more
difficult to achieve for PredictionBook.</p>

<p>The resulting data from Metaculus is <a href="./data/met.csv">here</a>, for
PredictionBook it's <a href="./data/pb.csv">here</a>.</p>

<h3>For Metaculus</h3>

<p>The Metaculus data is relatively easy to obtain:
The forecasts are available on a JSON API at
<code>https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/?page=</code>. Fortunately,
<a href="https://github.com/gimpf/">gimpf</a> has already published <a href="https://github.com/gimpf/metaculus-question-stats">a collection of
scripts</a> for fetching &amp;
analysing Metaculus data, I reused their script <code>fetch</code> to download the
raw JSON. I then converted the distinct page objects in the generated
file to a list of questions:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /usr/local/src
$ git clone https://github.com/gimpf/metaculus-question-stats
$ cd metaculus-question-stats
$ ./fetch
$ z site
$ jq -s '[.]|flatten' &lt;/usr/local/src/metaculus/data-questions-raw.json &gt;data/metaculus.json
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting data is available <a href="./data/metaculus.json">here</a>.</p>

<p>I then wrote a python script to convert the JSON data to CSV in the form
<code>id,questionrange,result,probability,range</code> (<code>id</code> is a unique ID per
question, which will come in handy later), while also filtering out
yet unresolved questions and range questions. Here, <code>id</code> is a unique
numerical ID per question, which will come in handy later, <code>questionrange</code>
is the duration between the time for creating and resolving the question,
<code>result</code> is the result of the question (either 0 or 1), <code>probability</code>
is the probability given by the predictor <code>$]0;1[$</code>, and <code>range</code> is the
duration between the forecast and the resolution.</p>

<p>The script is not terribly interesting: It just reads in the JSON data,
parses and traverses it, printing the CSV in the process.</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import json
import time

from time import mktime

f=open("../../data/metaculus.json")
jsondata=json.load(f)

for page in jsondata:
    for question in page["results"]:
        if question["possibilities"]["type"]=="binary" and (question["resolution"]==1 or question["resolution"]==0):
            try:
                restime=time.strptime(question["resolve_time"],"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ")
            except:
                restime=time.strptime(question["resolve_time"],"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
            try:
                createtime=time.strptime(question["created_time"],"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ")
            except:
                createtime=time.strptime(question["created_time"],"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
            for pred in question["prediction_timeseries"]:
                timediff=mktime(restime)-pred["t"]
                qtimediff=mktime(restime)-mktime(createtime)
                print("{},{},{},{},{}".format(question["id"], qtimediff, question["resolution"], pred["community_prediction"], timediff))
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting CSV file contains over 40k predictions.</p>

<h3>For PredictionBook</h3>

<p>As far as I know, PredictionBook doesn't publish the forecasting
data over an API. However, all individual predictions are visible
on the web, which means I had to parse the HTML itself using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Soup_(HTML_parser)">BeautifulSoup</a>.</p>

<p>This time the code is more complex, but just slightly so: It starts at
the <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions/page/1">first page</a>
of predictions, and loops down to the <a href="https://predictionbook.com/predictions/page/326">last
one</a>, every time iterating
through the questions on that page.</p>

<p>It then loops through the predictions on each question and parses out
the date for the prediction and the credence.</p>

<p>Every question on PredictionBook has two dates related to its
resolution: the 'known on' date, for which the resolution was originally
planned, and by which the result should be known, and the 'judged on'
date, on which the resolution was actually made. I take the second date
to avoid predictions with negative differences between prediction and
resolution time.</p>

<p>Also, the 'known on' date has the CSS class <code>date created_at</code>, which
doesn't seem right.</p>

<p>The output of this script is in the same format as the one for Metaculus
data: <code>id,questionrange,result,probability,range</code> (although here
<code>probability</code> can also be 0 and 1, which Metaculus doesn't allow).</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python2

import urllib2
import sys
import time

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from time import mktime

def showforecasts(linkp, res):
    urlp="https://predictionbook.com{}".format(linkp)

    try:

    except (urllib2.HTTPError, urllib2.URLError) as e:
        return
    datap=conp.read()
    soupp=BeautifulSoup(datap, "html.parser")

    timedata=soupp.find(lambda tag:tag.name=="p" and "Created by" in tag.text)

        if forecasts!=[]:
            est=float(r.find_all("span", class_="confidence")[0].text.strip("%"))/100
        else:
            continue
        estimated=r.find("span", class_="date").get("title")
        esttime=time.strptime(estimated,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC")
        print("{},{},{},{},{}".format(linkp.replace("/predictions/", ""), mktime(restime)-mktime(createtime), res, est, mktime(restime)-mktime(esttime)))

for page in range(1,400):
    url="https://predictionbook.com/predictions/page/{}".format(page)
    req=urllib2.Request(url, headers={"User-Agent" : "Firefox"})
    try:
        con=urllib2.urlopen(req)
    except (urllib2.HTTPError, urllib2.URLError) as e:
        continue
    data=con.read()
    soup=BeautifulSoup(data, "html.parser")
    predright=soup.find_all("li", {"class": "prediction right"})
    predwrong=soup.find_all("li", {"class": "prediction wrong"})
    for pred in predright:
        linkp=pred.span.a.get("href")
        showforecasts(linkp, "1.0")
    for pred in predwrong:
        linkp=pred.span.a.get("href")
        showforecasts(linkp, "0.0")
</code></pre>

<p>Surprisingly, both platforms had almost the same amount of individual
predictions on binary resolved questions: ~48k for Metaculus, and ~44k
for PredictionBook.</p>

<h2>Accuracy Between Forecasts</h2>

<p>The first approach I took was to simply take the probability, result and
range for all forecasts made, sort these forecasts into buckets by range
(e.g. one bucket for all forecasts made 1 day before their resolution
(and their results), one bucket for all forecasts made 2 days before
their resolution, and so on). I then calculated the Brier score for each
of these buckets, and then checked what the relation between brier score
and range (the time between forecast &amp; resolution) was (correlation &amp;
linear regression).</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>Now that the two datasets are available, they can be properly analyzed.</p>

<p>First, the raw data is loaded from the two CSV files and then the ID is
converted to integer, and the rest of the fields are converted to floats
(the range is a float for some Metaculus questions, and while the result
can only take on 0 or 1, using float there makes it easier to calculate
the brier score using <code>mse.set</code>):</p>

<pre><code>.fc(.ic("../../data/pb.csv"));pbraw::csv.load()
.fc(.ic("../../data/met.csv"));metraw::csv.load()

pbdata::+flr({0&lt;*|x};{(1:$*x),1.0:$'1_x}'pbraw)
metdata::+flr({0&lt;*|x};{(1:$*x),1.0:$'1_x}'metraw)
</code></pre>

<p>To compare the accuracy between forecasts, one can't deal with individual
forecasts, only with sets of forecasts and outcomes. Here, I organise
the predictions into buckets according to range. The size of the buckets
seems important: bigger buckets contain bigger datasets, but are also
less granular. Also, should the size of buckets increase with increasing
range (e.g. exponentially: the first bucket is for all predictions made
one day or less before resolution, the second bucket for all predictions
made 2-4 days before resolution, the third bucket for all predictions
4-8 days before resolution, and so on) or stay the same?</p>

<p>I decided to use evenly sized buckets, and test with varying sizes of
one day, one week, one month (30 days) and one year (365 days).</p>

<pre><code>spd::24*60*60
spw::7*spd
spm::30*spd
spy::365*spd
dpbdiffs::{_x%spd}pbdata@3
wpbdiffs::{_x%spw}'pbdata@3
mpbdiffs::{_x%spm}'pbdata@3
ypbdiffs::{_x%spy}'pbdata@3
dmetdiffs::{_x%spd}'metdata@3
wmetdiffs::{_x%spw}'metdata@3
mmetdiffs::{_x%spm}'metdata@3
ymetdiffs::{_x%spy}'metdata@3
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier Score</a> is
a scoring rule for binary forecasts. It takes into account both
calibration and resolution by basically being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error">mean squared
error</a> of forecast
(<code>$f_{t}$</code>) and outcome (<code>$o_{t}$</code>):</p>

<div>
    $$BS=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^{N}(f_{t}-o_{t})^{2}$$
</div>

<p>In Klong, it's easy to implement (and also available through
the function <code>mse.set</code>):</p>

<pre><code>brier::{mu((x-y)^2)}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, one can calculate the brier score for the forecasts and outcomes
in each bucket (here I only show it for the days buckets, but it's
similar for weeks, months and years):</p>

<pre><code>pbress::pbdata@1
pbfcs::pbdata@2

dpbdg::=dpbdiffs
dpbdiffbrier::{(dpbdiffs@*x),brier(pbfcs@x;pbress@x)}'dpbdg
dpbdiffbrier::dpbdiffbrier@&lt;*'dpbdiffbrier

metress::metdata@1
metfcs::metdata@2

dmetdg::=dmetdiffs
dmetdiffbrier::{(dmetdiffs@*x),brier(metfcs@x;metress@x)}'dmetdg
dmetdiffbrier::dmetdiffbrier@&lt;*'dmetdiffbrier
</code></pre>

<p>Every <code>diffbrier</code> list contains lists with two elements, the first
one being the time between forecast and resolution, and the second
one being the brier score for all forecasts made in that time. For
example, <code>ypbdiffbrier</code> (the brier scores for all predictions made on
PredictionBook 1/2/.../10 years before resolution) is</p>

<pre><code>[[0 0.162]
[1 0.168]
[2 0.164]
[3 0.159]
[4 0.13]
[5 0.12]
[6 0.128]
[7 0.147]
[8 0.121]
[9 0.215]
[10 0.297]]
</code></pre>

<p>(Brier scores truncated using <code>{(*x),(_1000**|x)%1000}'ypbdiffbrier</code>).</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>First, one can check how high the range of these two datasets really is.
The PredictionBook forecasts with the highest range span 3730 days
(more than 10 years), for Metaculus it's 1387 days (nearly 4 years).</p>

<p>One can now look at the correlation between range and Brier score first
for Metaculus, and then for PredictionBook:</p>

<pre><code>    cor@+dmetdiffbrier
-0.209003553312708299
    cor@+wmetdiffbrier
-0.255272030357598017
    cor@+mmetdiffbrier
-0.304951730306590024
    cor@+ymetdiffbrier
-0.545313822494739663
    cor@+dpbdiffbrier
-0.0278634569332282397
    cor@+wpbdiffbrier
0.0121150252846883416
    cor@+mpbdiffbrier
0.0752110636215072744
    cor@+ypbdiffbrier
0.411830122003081247
</code></pre>

<p>For Metaculus, the results are pretty astonishing: the correlation is
negative for all four options, meaning that the higher the range of
the question, the lower the Brier score (and therefore, the higher the
accuracy)! And the correlation is extremly low either: -0.2 is quite
formidable.</p>

<p>PredictionBook, on the other hand, is not as surprising: the correlations
are mostly weak and indicate that accuracy doesn't change with range
– a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_result">null result</a>.</p>

<p>Visualizing the forecasts with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot">scatterplots</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">linear
regressions</a> shows a
very similar picture (red dots are for Metaculus forecasts, blue dots
are for PredictionBook forecasts):</p>

<p><em>Scatterplot with linear regression for Metaculus &amp; PredictionBook forecasts by range (in years)</em></p>

<p>The high amounts of noise are probably due to the low number of
predictions for single days (or, in the case of weeks and months, for
years/months with a high range, as not enough questions with this range
have resolved yet).</p>

<h3>Why Assume Accuracy will Increase?</h3>

<p>I believe that this finding is quite surprising.</p>

<p>A priori, one would believe that beliefs about the near future are
generally more accurate than beliefs about the far future: We can predict
the weather in 2 minutes far better than the weather in 6 months, we can
say much more about the position of a rock in an hour than in 100 years,
more about the popularity of a political party in 2 months as opposed
to 10 years. Even in reasonably chaotic systems, one should expect to
become more and more accurate the closer one comes to the expected time.</p>

<p>Take, for example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum">double
pendulum</a>: I am totally
able to predict its position &amp; velocity 100ms before resolution time,
but 1s before and it's already getting more difficult. Information,
like nearly everything else, has diminishing value, posteriors converge
continuously towards truth.</p>

<p><!--TODO: Also, what are some probability theory &amp; information theory
theorems for this?--></p>

<h3>Possible Explanations</h3>

<p>So, what is the reason for this rather weird finding? Several possible
reasons come to mind.</p>

<h4>Range and Biased Questions</h4>

<p>The most obvious solution is that the analysis above is absolute bogus and
completely meaningless: It compares questions about global catastrophic
risks to popular banana brands <!--TODO: link both Ragnarök series &amp;
banana question-->, very different kinds of questions with very different
kinds of forecasts.</p>

<p>Here, one would assume that the longer-term questions asked are generally
easier to predict, and that the effect goes away when one compares
predictions among very similary questions (or, better, within questions).</p>

<p>Generally, the long-term questions we prefer asking seem to be more
menable to forecasting than short-term questions: development of
population sizes, the climate, especially the movement of interstellar
bodies is much more thoroughly modelled than the development of markets,
elections and the weather. This is of course only a weak trend, but
one that could influence the questions (as will be investigated in
<a href="#Accuracy-Between-Questions">this section</a>).</p>

<h3>Low Sample Sizes With High Ranges</h3>

<p>Another question one might ask is: How big are the sample sizes at the
tails when the range is high?</p>

<p>This is important: low sample sizes increase noise dramatically, and
make findings much less reliable.</p>

<p><!--TODO: find a way to test the statistical significance here, sometime later--></p>

<p>To get a rough overview over the sample sizes, on can look at the
number of samples for each bucket. I generated charts for sample
sizes for <a href="./img/range_and_forecasting_accuracy/dss_plot.png">days</a>,
<a href="./img/range_and_forecasting_accuracy/wss_plot.png">weeks</a>,
<a href="./img/range_and_forecasting_accuracy/mss_plot.png">months</a> and
<a href="./img/range_and_forecasting_accuracy/yss_plot.png">years</a>, but I'll
only show the chart for months (the others are quite similar):</p>

<pre><code>mssplot::.oc("mss_plot.eps")

<p><em>Sample sizes for predictions with a range of n months, sorted and graphed.</em></p>

<p>The red bars stand for Metaculus sample sizes, the blue bars stand for
PredictionBook sample sizes.</p>

<p>As one can see, the sample sizes have a drastical skew towards recent
predictions, not surprising for relatively young platforms (although 10
years for PredictionBook is sizable by internet standards, it's not that
much compared to the range of some predictions on the platform).</p>

<p>This can be seen in the data as well: More than 77% percent of Metaculus predictions
and 75% of PredictionBook questions have a range of less than one year:</p>

<pre><code>ypbss::{(ypbdiffs@*x),#x}'ypbdg

    29724%(+/*|+ypbss)
0.754052614221568279
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that the dataset becomes richer the older these platforms become.</p>

<p>For days the skew is not as strong for Metaculus (moreso for
PredictionBook), but still relevant:</p>

<pre><code>    10#dmetss
[[0 406] [1 543] [2 633] [3 464] [4 546] [5 477] [6 440] [7 307] [8 240] [9 297]]

</code></pre>

<p>Because in the linear regression all datapoints are weighted equally,
it could very well be that a tiny bit of noise at the tails dominates
the entire regression.</p>

<h4>Simpson's Paradox</h4>

<h2>Accuracy Between Questions</h2>

<p>Another way to determine at the relation between forecasting accuracy
and range is to look at the range of questions and not of individual
forecasts.</p>

<p>In this case, this means taking the forecasts on all questions with
a given range, and calculating the brier score on these forecasts,
sorting them into buckets related to range.</p>

<h3>Determining the Range of a Question</h3>

<p>The range of a question is determined by taking the time difference
between the opening time (the time when the first prediction on the
question could have been made) and the resolution time. One could imagine
other metrics to determine the range of a question: the mean range
for forecasts of that question, the median range for forecasts on that
question, time differences between writing/opening and closing/resolution
times of the question, and probably many more.</p>

<p>Here, the range of a question was set to the time difference between opening
time and resolution time. The reasons for this were threefold:</p>

<p>First, I had no clear idea about the time when people were making
forecasts on questions. Are most of the forecasts made just after
opening, or just before closing? Or is the distribution uniform on the
time between opening and closing? And are these distributions different
on long-range as opposed to short-range questions? Also, I was unsure
whether taking the mean time for forecasts would just be the same as
comparing forecasts directly. So taking the median or the mean of the
forecasts made was less preferable.</p>

<p>Second, what I cared about here was the uncertainty of questions at time
of writing, not at time of prediction. This is much better tracked by
opening time than by proxy on the forecasts.</p>

<p>Third, there was the question of data availability. Both Metaculus and
PredictionBook publish opening/resolution times, but PredictionBook has
no clear distinction between closing and resolution time (there is,
however, a distinction between effective resolution time and planned
resolution time ("When was the question resolved?" vs. "When should the
question have been resolved?")).</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>First, the dataset grouped by forecasts had to be grouped by the question
ID, in both cases a positive integer. The resulting datastructure should
have the structure</p>

<pre><code>[[id open-resolve-timediff [outcomes] [forecasts] [forecast-resolve-timediffs]]*]`
</code></pre>

<p>where the splat just indicates the inner list can be repeated. This
was achieved by first finding the grouping of forecasts by question ID,
then concatenating the ID, the question range, the list of outcomes,
the list of forecasts and the list of forecast ranges:</p>

<pre><code>metquestions::{(*x@0),(*x@1),2_x}'+'(+metdata)@=*metdata
pbquestions::{(*x@0),(*x@1),2_x}'+'(+pbdata)@=*pbdata
</code></pre>

<p>Strictly speaking, the outcomes could be a single element, since for
every question there is only one well-defined outcome, but this makes
it easier to later compute the brier score.
Showcase:</p>

<pre><code>metquestions@10
    [474 497590.0 [0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0] [0.79 0.8 0.99 0.8 0.8 0.65 0.65 0.8 0.8 0.81 0.81 0.7] [249575.65223908424 249548.86438822746 245775.7940876484 242420.23024630547 230434.71577501297 230276.97260832787 230111.41609930992 229967.06126213074 216594.73318576813 207687.5192539692 177898.677213192 151590.6441845894]]
</code></pre>

<p>The next step involves merging the forecasts on questions with the
same range (rounded by day/week/month/year). This was achieved by first
dividing the question range by <code>spd</code>/<code>spw</code>/<code>spm</code>/<code>spy</code>, then grouping
the questions by the resulting rounded range. Afterwards, questions
ID and forecast range were dropped and the forecast and result arrays
were concatenated in order. The resulting array had the structure
<code>[[question-range [results] [forecasts]]*]</code>. Aftewards, computing the
brier score was quite straightforward by selectively applying it in a
mapped function. The resulting array was sorted by range, for convenience.</p>

<pre><code>dmetquestions::{(_(x@1)%spd),x@[2 3]}'metquestions
dmetquestions::{(**x),,/'+{1_x}'x}'dmetquestions@=*'dmetquestions
dqmetbrier::{(*x),brier@1_x}'dmetquestions
dqmetbrier::dqmetbrier@&lt;dqmetbrier
dqmetbrier@19
    [20 0.210210798122065727]
</code></pre>

<p>This was of course implemented for both datasets and for all four kinds
of buckets.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Again I use linear regressions, correlation coefficients and scatter
plots to inadequately analyze the data.</p>

<p>For accuracy between questions, the results were mostly not very
interesting:</p>

<pre><code>    cor@dqmetbrier
-0.021357561237633882
        cor@+wqmetbrier
-0.0564522173076630489

        cor@+yqpbbrier
-0.542853871095691028
</code></pre>

<p>With a high resolution (looking at days and weeks, similarly months),
the correlations are very near zero, probably just by noise. But the
correlations for the range in years and across-question accuracy is
~-0.5 in both cases. This is curious, and I have no explanation of what
exactly is going on. Perhaps this is just a random result in both cases,
which works because the datasets are just too small (4 &amp; 10 for Metaculus
and PredictionBook, respectively)? Or is it picking up on a real effect
only visible with ranges as high as years? I don't know.</p>

<p>And now: linear regressions and scatterplots!</p>

<p>The following are scatterplots with range on the X-axis and accuracy
(calculated using the Brier score) on the Y-axis. Again, red dots/lines
are for Metaculus data, and blue dots/lines are for PredictionBook data.</p>

<p><em>Scatterplot with linear regression for Metaculus &amp; PredictionBook question accuracy by range (in years)</em></p>

<p>Note that these are indeed different from the results in the <a href="#Results">analysis
on between-forecast accuracy</a>. Especially, it seems like the
linear regressions are less steep:</p>

<pre><code>lreg(dmetdiffbrier)
    [-0.0000372520623478135807 0.190620666721820704]
lreg(dqmetbrier)
    [-0.00000947572947427605725 0.177148138436629167]
</code></pre>

<p>The general trend seems to be: questions with a higher range have
a higher accuracy than questions with a lower range. In itself,
this is already a fascinating finding, and might explain some of
the effect seen with accuracy between forecasts in the <a href="#Accuracy-Between-Forecasts">previous
section</a>). On the other hand, the data is
still very noisy, and the interpolation on PredictionBook data shows no
relation at all for the four timespans, while having questions with a
much higher range than Metaculus.</p>

<p>All in all, it's plausible that the relation of range and accuracy
between questions explains the the weird relation for accuracy and range
between forecasts, but I don't know enough statistics to tease these
out exactly. My intuition tells me that the effect on accuracy between
questions is too small to explain the whole anomaly between forecasts.</p>

<p><!--</p>

<h3>Why Longer Range Questions More Accurate?</h3>

<p>The big question now is: Why do forecasts on predictions on questions
with a higher range generally receive better Brier scores?</p>

<p>TODO: write something about bias here
--></p>

<h2>Accuracy Within Questions</h2>

<p>If there exists any bias in regard to what kinds of questions get asked in
relation to their range, how can we correct for this bias?</p>

<p>One approach could be to compare very similar questions, such as only
questions about artificial intelligence, the cost &amp; speed of gene
sequencing or autonomous cars, and examine the relation of range and
accuracy within these categories. This might eliminate bias resulting
from questions in different kinds of domains being easier or harder
to forecast.</p>

<p>Here, I take a simpler approach. I examine the relation of range and accuracy
within questions; are forecasts made on the same question later generally
more accurate than forecasts made on a question earlier?</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>In order to do this, it seems like questions with higher numbers of
forecasts on them are are more likely to give clearer results than
questions with only a dozen or so forecasts. The Metaculus dataset
contains predictions on 557 questions, the PredictionBook dataset 13356:</p>

<pre><code>    #metquestions
557
    #pbquestions
13356
</code></pre>

<p>I filtered out questions with <code>&lt;100</code> predictions on them, resulting
in 323 questions from the Metaculus dataset and 0 (!) questions from
PredictionBook:</p>

<pre><code>    wmetq::flr({100&lt;#x@2};metquestions)
    wpbq::flr({100&lt;#x@2};pbquestions)
    #wmetq
323
    #wpbq
0
</code></pre>

<p>This is not wholly surprising: Metaculus makes creating new questions
much harder, and more strongly encourages users to predict on existing
questions, with an elaborate tagging system for questions. PredictionBook
on the other hand simplifies the questions creation process, leaving
out moderation, complex resolution criteria etc. Still, I'm surprised
– there must be at least <em>one</em> PredictionBook question popular enough
for 100 forecasts! But apparently not.</p>

<p>So, what is the highest number of predictions a PredictionBook question
has gotten?</p>

<pre><code>    pbl::{#x@2}'pbquestions
    pbl::pbl@&lt;pbl
    |/pbl
99
</code></pre>

<p>You got to be kidding me.</p>

<p>Anyway, within the usable questions with <code>&gt;100</code> predictions, the
predictions of each question are first sorted by range (here time between
forecast and resolution) and then separated into chunks containing 50
predictions each, so that the resulting structure of <code>cwmetq</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[
    [
        [[result_array] [50_earliest_predictions] [ranges]]
        [[result_array] [50_next_predictions] [ranges]]
        …
    ]
    …
]
</code></pre>

<p>The code works by iterating the function <code>sac</code> over every question,
first sorting the values by range and then cutting the predictions into
chunks of size 50.</p>

<pre><code>chl::50
sac::{t::+2_x;+'(chl*1+!(#t):%chl):_t}
chsmetq::sac'wmetq
</code></pre>

<h4>Interlude: It's Under 102</h4>

<p>When I first ran this code, I then also wanted to check how many chunks
each question had:</p>

<pre><code>    #'chsmetq
[3 3 3 3 3 3 … 3 3 ]
</code></pre>

<p>The result was, to say the least, confusing – where did all those 3s
come from‽ Surely, there are questions with more than 150 forecasts
(which I knew, <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/126/will-2016-be-the-warmest-year-on-record/">this question about 2016 being the warmest year on
record</a>
has 765 forecasts)!</p>

<pre><code>    10#{#x@3}'metquestions
[101 101 94 60 101 61 101 101 101 68]
    |/{#x@3}'metquestions

</code></pre>

<p><img src="./img/range_and_forecasting_accuracy/api_incomplete.png" alt="If an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist" title="If an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist" /></p>

<p>I initially suspected a bug in my code, but to my surprise, after further
investigation, it turned out that the Metaculus API returns timeseries
with elements removed so that the length was always 101.</p>

<p>I can think of two reasons to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Metaculus wants to prevent other entities from using the predictions to create stronger forecasting algorithms that could rival the Metaculus algorithm</li>
<li>It was programmed in as a hard limit when Metaculus wasn't as big as it is now, and never changed</li>
</ul>

<p>I mailed the support address on the site, asking for a full timeseries
on resolved binary questions.</p>

<p><!--TODO: either update or become more penetrant--></p>

<hr />

<p>Now for each chunk of size 50 we can compute the brier score and the mean
of the range, and subsequently convert the ranges from seconds to days:</p>

<pre><code>pchsmetq::{+mu(*|x),brier@2#x}'x}'chsmetq
pchsmetq::{{((_*x):%(3600*24)),1_x}'x}'pchsmetq
</code></pre>

<p>The dataset then has elements like this:</p>

<pre><code>    2#pchsmetq
[[[294 0.036422] [72 0.015188] [1 0.0016]]
[[57 0.002532] [35 0.001462] [28 0.0004]]]
</code></pre>

<p>Each element contains the mean range of a chunk in days and the accuracy
of the forecasts on that question within that chunk.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>We can now compute the linear regression for the chunks in each question:</p>

<pre><code>    2#lreg'pchsmetq
[[0.00011329877152681667 0.0038764502832194274] [0.0000675414847161572049 -0.00123699272197962153]]
</code></pre>

<p>We can also visualise the linear regression for each question by setting
it to zero outside the range of the oldest and newest chunks:</p>

<pre><code>sketch::{q::x;
    setrgb(.rn();.rn();.rn());
    pltr::{:[(x&gt;**q)|x&lt;**|q;0;lr(x;lreg(q))]};
    plot(pltr)}
sketch'pchsmetq
</code></pre>

<p><img src="./img/range_and_forecasting_accuracy/perquestion.png" alt="Linear regressions for the accuracy of questions by range in chunks of size 50" title="Linear regressions for the accuracy of questions by range in chunks of size 50" /></p>

<p><em>Linear regressions for the accuracy of questions by range in chunks of size 50.</em></p>

<p>The vertical bars are artifacts stemming from the fact that Klong
attempts to makes the discontinuous function continuous, connecting 0
and the linear regression.</p>

<p>Although the plot is kind of cool to look at, I'm not really sure what
it can tell us. My <em>guess</em> would be that it somewhat shows a trend
with higher ranges responding to higher Brier scores (and therefore
lower accuracy).</p>

<p>We can test whether this suspicion is acually correct by calculating the
average offset and the average ascension – if the ascension is positive,
our suspicion is confirmed.</p>

<pre><code>    mu'+lreg'pchsmetq
[0.00198030517003624986 0.0105472685809891273]
</code></pre>

<p>So it is true that accuracy within question <em>generally</em> is higher with
lower range. Everything else would have been surprising.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>Oh boy.
TODO:
Two different kinds of datasets
--></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Using two datasets with both ~45k predictions, having a range of
between 1 day and 10 years (thereby containing forcasts with short and
medium range)I have investigated the relation between the accuracy of
predictions and their range (that is, the time between the prediction
being made and the result of the prediction being known).</p>

<p>I have found that the data indicates three facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>For predictions made on any question, the predictions made a long
time before their resolution are generally more accurate than
predictions made a shorter time before their resolution. This
can be partially, but not completely explained by fact 2.</li>
<li>Questions with a longer range (that is, time between the question
being written and the question being resolved) generally have
a higher accuracy than questions with a shorter range.</li>
<li>Predictions made on the same question earlier are generally less
accurate than predictions that are made later.</li>
</ol>

<p>These results vary strongly between Metaculus and PredictionBook, with
observations 1. and 2. much weaker or non-existent in PredictionPook data
(observation 3. only holds for Metaculus, because there are no questions
on PredictionBook with enough forecasts to run the analysis).</p>

<p>These results suggest what to expect with questions with even higher range:
That later predictions on them will generally be more accurate, and that
the kinds of questions asked with a very high range might have an even
accuracy than questions with short and medium ranges.</p>

<p>However, there are plausible reasons to expect the trend from 1. and 2.
to reverse: The questions asked with very high range are not very
different from questions with medium range, and have a lot less
information available to make useful predictions on them; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">butterfly

in in systems that are relatively slow moving on human timescales (thus
easier to predict on medium timescales), but nearly completely random at
the scale of decades and/or centuries; the questions asked about longer
timescales are of a different kind and much less predictable.</p>

<p><!--TODO: in 1/2/5/10 years, will the linear regression coefficients for
these datasets still be positive/negative?--></p>

<p>I hope to update this analysis in the future, when data from predictions
with higher ranges has become available, and to check whether the findings
in this analysis continue to be correct.</p>
