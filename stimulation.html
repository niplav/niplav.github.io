<blockquote>
<p>The project follows standard neuroscience research protocols. In
the lab, study subjects (novices as well as experienced meditators),
don something that looks like a hairnet studded with ultrasonic
transducers. Over a period of five or 10 minutes, they receive
intermittent pulses of ultrasound energy. Ultrasound frequencies are
far above the threshold of human hearing, so the test subjects feel no
sensations, and because this is a placebo-controlled study, some people
receive no stimulation at all.</p>
<p>Participants may also undergo ultrasound stimulation while lying in
an MRI scanner that enables the researchers to gauge how different
brain regions respond to the intervention. “The biggest brain
and subjective reports are at about 20 minutes post-ultrasound,”
Sanguinetti says. “So there’s some change in the way the brain
regions are talking to each other.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The primary target is the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a region
deep in the brain that is massively connected with other structures and
is associated with the default mode network—active during daydreaming
and mind-wandering. Young and Sanguinetti theorize that the ultrasound
energy mutes activity in the PCC in much the same way meditation tames
the “monkey mind.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Experienced meditators report significant effects after undergoing
the ultrasound sessions, Sanguinetti says.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Adds Young, “We get these equanimity-related reports from the
participants without prompting. They don’t know that we’re looking
into anything related to meditation—we’re just some mad scientists
that want to put energy into their brain. They on their own report some
very meditation-like things.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“The general effect was, within the first week, an extreme quieting of
both inner and external space. The inner space became much stiller than
I was able to accomplish just by sitting for 45 minutes every day. With
the PCC ultrasound, it was within the first five minutes.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the individual's two-month post-completion evaluation, he
showed a significant score decrease in mood inventories, with virtually
no remaining anxiety or depression. The response pattern observed
may demonstrate that fUS [focused ultra-sound] targeting the amygdala
produces very specific symptom relief in anxiety, but not in depression
and obsessive thinking. In this previously treatment-resistant individual,
anxiety may have prevented the therapeutic response to previous treatments
for comorbid conditions in these patients. Indeed, extremely high levels
of general anxiety are often considered to be markers of non-response
to antidepressants, therapy, rTMS and ECT.</p>
