<h1>Cryonics Outside of the United States</h1>

<p>Hello! You are probably here because you are considering signing up for
cryonics or are already signed up and want to improve your chances of
making it into the future.</p>

<p>This text deals with the period from signing up to the moment when you are
stored in your cryonics organisation's dewar. In particular, it deals with
the questions about which additional documents to fill out, which people
you have to talk to, and where you could move before dying to improve
your chances of your body landing in liquid nitrogen after deanimation.</p>

<p>This guide does not deal with the question whether it is a good idea to
sign up for cryonics, or how to do so in the US. I assume you have made
up your mind about that already. Coincidentally, I believe signing up
for cryonics is a good idea (see <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html" title="Why Cryonics Makes Sense">Urban
2016</a>
and perhaps my own <a href="./considerations_on_cryonics.html" title="Considerations on Cryonics">cost-benefit
analysis</a>).
For instructions on how to sign up for cryonics in the US, see
<a href="">here</a><!--TODO: link cryonics signup guide-->.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>This text is structured as a nested list, iterating through the possible
options for each section and subsection:</p>

<ul>
<li>General Considerations: Things that are generally wise to do, regardless of place of residence (this point can also be a subsection of any other section)</li>
<li>Place of Residence: Where the cryonicist is currently located (ideally, a permanent residence with citizenship in the country they reside in)
<ul>
<li>Contract with a {Country} Organisation: Depending on the location of your cryonics organisation, different regulations apply (though most of that should be handled through your membership application and contract)
<ul>
<li>Type of Death: Depending on your type of death, different considerations apply. Generally, this text divides conditions of death into slow/medium/fast (how much time do you have from the moment you know that you will very likely die to the moment of your death?), young/old (how old are you at the time you die) and deteriorating/non-deteriorating (is your brain deteriorating as you are dying?)
<ul>
<li>Types of Logistical Hurdle: There are several steps that need to happen between the cryonicist being alive and them being in safe preservation. Improving their probability of success and speed on each one of them is beneficial. These are:
<ul>
<li>Getting near the storage facility</li>
<li>Getting into a hospital</li>
<li>Getting resuscitated</li>
<li>Being cooled</li>
<li>Getting to the cryonics organisations storage facility</li>
<li>Being vitrified</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, this guide will very likely never be finished: Collecting
the information about all regulatory hurdles in all countries for all
possible causes of death and all possible steps to successful preservation
would probably take more than a lifetime of work, and be obsolete by
the time it is finished.</p>

<p>My initial plan for this document is to first document my personal
strategy for cryonics signup, and then search for people who have signed
up for cryonics outside of the US to ask them about their considerations.</p>

<p>Ideally, this document would grow over time, as people from different
countries contribute the precautions they have taken.</p>

<p><strong>If you don't have a US citizenship and have signed up with cryonics, or
have considered and research it, but rejected it for logistical reasons,
I would <a href="./about.html#Contact">like to talk to you</a> about why and how
(email address is rot-13ed <!--TODO: link-->).</strong></p>
