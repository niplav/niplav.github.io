<h4>“Ordinary Life Improvements”</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.gwern.net/Notes#ordinary-life-improvements">Gwern 2019a</a></p>

<p>In the section "Ordinary Life Improvements" the first sentence read
"[It can be hard to see the gradual improvement of most goods over
time]{,smallcaps}, but I think one way to get a handle on them is to
look". The comma before "smallcaps" was misplaced.</p>

<li>A period '.' was missing after "And we can draw on all sorts of knowledge to do better³"</li>
<li>With "(despite increases in marijuana use not followed by any schizophrenia increases / hormone replacement therapy correlates with mortality reduction in women so it definitely helps and doesn’t hurt” etc." -> there was a missing parenthesis</li>
<li>"surely this observations" -> should be "surely this observation"</li>

<ul>
<li>"or visual web ads are more less intrusive than audio" -> "or visual web ads are less intrusive than audio"</li>
<li>"then that suggests that eliminating ads entirely (going from 11% to 0%) to 0%" -> the second "0%" shouldn't be there</li>
<li>"However, I believe it would be safe to say that the <em>n</em>s for the" -> malcompiled markdown for "<em>n</em>s"</li>
<li>"from any section andnotjust from the top news and video" -> in quote should probably be "and not just"</li>

<p><a href="https://www.gwern.net/Prediction-markets">Gwern 2019f</a></p>

<ul>
<li>In the paragraph "I shorted 10 at 18% since I thought the true odds are more like" -> suddenly switched tense from past to present</li>
